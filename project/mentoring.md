# How to do mentoring

There was once a question around here that contained this kind of information, and the piece that stuck with me the most was don't touch their keyboard

In short, tell your junior how to accomplish what they are trying to do, but do not do it for them.

But in addition to that, here are some other tips:

Encourage Google (or any other search tool). If you know the answer can be found online easily, tell them to look it up instead of telling them the answer. Ultimately you want to teach them how to teach themselves, and not have them become dependent on you.
Make yourself available to answer questions. If you are ever not available or do not wish to be interrupted, make it clear to them that they should hold their questions until a specified time.
Do code reviews regularly to tell them what they are doing right/wrong. Use this as an opportunity to point out best practices
Begin early with best practices. It's better to take extra time to teach them the right way, than to try and change their methods later on.
Get them started early with planning/documentating what they are going to be doing instead of letting them begin by writing code.
Be open to learning from them. They probably spend more time than you learning, and it's possible that they learn something that you didn't know.
Help them learn from their mistakes. There are going to be mistakes, so be sure you show them that mistakes are part of learning, and that they should use them as an opportunity to learn.
(From RuneFS below) Instead of telling them how to do something, try to help them figure it out themself. This will help improve their ability to logically work through a problem, and increases their learning ability
(From RuneFS below) Instead of telling them what they did wrong, tell them of ways they can improve it. Be sure to include why your way is better than theirs. This will boost their confidence instead of weaken it. Of course, if they aren't listening to you then don't be afraid to just tell them to do it the right way :)
