# Writing an abstract / Call for paper

The important thing about writing the CFP talk abstract is that this will probably be what they put in the conference program about your talk. So that puts you in the particularly strange situation where if you change your talk in the subsequent few months, you might still have a really inaccurate talk description.

## Keep it abstract

I use the abstract part of talk abstract literally: I try not to include too many specific details to give me some leeway to let the talk take me where it wants to go later when I build it. You can’t be too amorphous to the extent where you’re not saying anything, otherwise the organizers won’t pick it, but you can talk in more broader themes than you would otherwise.

## Keep it interesting

As I said, this will probably be in the talk program, and if the conference you’re presenting at has multiple tracks, you’ll want to write something interesting enough to pull people in and choose your talk.

## Writing the note to organizers

Some CFPs will let you include a quick, private note to the conference organizers. You can put anything you want in here, but be brief (organizers are busy, busy people), and it might be a good idea to talk more honestly about why you think giving this talk is really important to conference attendees. That’s really the kicker (and it should show through in your abstract as well). People want to be moved by interesting, new perspectives, even if they don’t necessarily agree with them at the onset. Differentiate yourself, include some humor, and you’ll fare well.
