Improvisation means:
- the act of art of improvising
- Being spontaneus
- Making stuff up

How to do improvisation:
- Play, engaging in something only beacuse you like it
- Let yourself fail. 
  - The hard part of each failing, it is ok with that and accept that failure as a natural way of things.
  - Failing does not make you a failure.
- Listening:
  - Listening is the willing to change
  - We should listen more than just enough to respond, we should listen everything before to answer√π
  - If we don't listen enough is because we already made up our mind
- Say yes
- Play the game
- Relax and have fun
