## Talks and storytelling
Repetition is a great way to tell your story, and all talks, one way or another, are stories. If you go back and watch a Steve Jobs keynote, virtually every single keynote finished with a recap. There was no new information provided, but it served as a bookend to what he was trying to convey. He also typically did the same thing at the top of every section: he’d give you a quick few bullet points of what he was about to talk about in greater detail. By giving people the same information in a slightly different way, you’re giving them additional context with which they can grab hold of the idea you’re explaining. This is especially important when you’re trying to explain a complicated subject.

Think about using this to your advantage in your talk. Add recap sections before you move on to the next topic. Add a final one- or two-minute closing section that recaps everything you said. Underline and repeat important concepts one or two times, so people know it’s important.

Repeat yourself. Reiterate what you just said. Rephrase what you just said. It’ll help persuade people to remember what you’re saying.

# How to stick ideas
1. *Simplicity*
We must create ides both simple and profound. The Golden Rule is the ultimate model of simplicity: a one-sentence statement so profound that an individual could spend a life-time learning to follow it.

2. *Unexpectedness*
We need to violate people's expectations. We need to be counterintuitive. We must generate interest and curiosity. We can engage people's curiosity over a long period of time by systematically "opening gaps" in their knowledge and then filling those gaps.

3. *Concreteness*
We must explain our ideas in terms of human actions, in terms of sensory information. This is where so much business communication goes awry. Mission statements, synergies, strategies, visions—they are often ambiguous to the point of being meaningless. Naturally sticky ideas are full of concrete images—ice-filled bathtubs, apples with razors—because our brains are wired to remember concrete data. In proverbs, abstract truths are often encoded in concrete language: “A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.” Speaking concretely is the only way to ensure that our idea will mean the same thing to everyone in our audience.

4. *Credibility*
Sticky ideas have to carry their own credentials. We need ways to help people test our ideas for themselves—a “try before you buy” philosophy for the world of ideas.

5. *Emotions*
How do we get people to care about our ideas? We make them feel something. How do we get people to care about our ideas? We make them feel something.

6. *Stories*
Research shows that mentally rehearsing a situation helps us perform better when we encounter that situation in the physical environment.
