## Talks and storytelling
Repetition is a great way to tell your story, and all talks, one way or another, are stories. If you go back and watch a Steve Jobs keynote, virtually every single keynote finished with a recap. There was no new information provided, but it served as a bookend to what he was trying to convey. He also typically did the same thing at the top of every section: he’d give you a quick few bullet points of what he was about to talk about in greater detail. By giving people the same information in a slightly different way, you’re giving them additional context with which they can grab hold of the idea you’re explaining. This is especially important when you’re trying to explain a complicated subject.

Think about using this to your advantage in your talk. Add recap sections before you move on to the next topic. Add a final one- or two-minute closing section that recaps everything you said. Underline and repeat important concepts one or two times, so people know it’s important.

Repeat yourself. Reiterate what you just said. Rephrase what you just said. It’ll help persuade people to remember what you’re saying.
