## Success:
- Get used of rejection
- Keep alive your dreams
- Focus on culture
- Focus on people
- Ignore your litle man that stops you to do things
- Gest inspired
- Stay focused
- Customers #1, employee #2, shareholders #3
- Don't complain, look for opportunities
- Have passion
- Favoring consistency over intensity: we should do often the things we care, every moment in a while, instead of doing something a lot in a short time of period
- Be the change you want to see
- Break the rules
- Train your mind
- Be patient
- Take accountability
- Outdo yourself, always try to be better, everyday
- Be the last to speak: A great leader always heard what everyone has to say, don't nod the face, he asks questions to understand everything, he gives to everyone the space and the ability to feel that they have contributed.
- Be authentic
- Always think why you do things

## Motivation
As long as the task involved only mechanical skills:
- If you *reward* something do you get *more* of that behaviour
- If you *punish* something do you get *less* of that behaviour

This does not work when the task involved cognitive skills:
- If you don't pay people enough, they won't be motivated
- After money, there are three factors that leads to better performance and personal satisfaction: autonomy, mastery and purpose.

# Relantionship
- Don't change people outside, if they want they will change
- If we are always mean to people who have hurt us, we are giving the perfect reason to not listen us. Whereas a calm, dignified confession of vulnerability is nearly impossible to ignore
- The essence of talking about of himself is premerely in self-clarification, not merely in hearing our voices.
- We can ends up understanding ourselves listening to the stories of other people. Usually anyone thinks that something that you say are important and others are boring, this is wrong.
- In listening, can also shape, tease out, cut out, emphasise - in the name of getting the latent really good story to emerge from our companion's mind. So when listening, stop your companion digressing, bring back together to the last coherent and emotionally 'alive' part of the story. Draw them from numb surface details to deeper emotional realities, like 'What did feel like for you?' . Use signs that suggests an open mind. Don't do anything that close off a vulnerable confession, say 'go on..' you are not to judge, you are a friend. A good listener knows the one of the best ways to understand an issue in one's own life is to hear it discussed through the life of someone else - and futhermore he has the editing skills to make sure they can find themselves in the word of others. That way, listening will no longer a chore.

# Leadership
- The golden circle (why / how / what): From the lowest level to the highest level of leadership. Everyone knows what they do, some of them knows how to do them, and very few knows why they do them and for why we intends "what's your purpose? What's your cause? What do you beleif? Why your organization do exists". The inspiring people communicate from the inside to out, before they explains why, after how and finally what. Usually a lot of people they just explain what and how and make implicity why. People buy why we do it.
Our neocortex brain corresponds with 'what level', it is responsible with all rational and analytical thought and language. The middle two sections make up our limbic brains and they are responsible for all of our feelings/decisions and that's why people buy why we do it.
This people spend a lot for new things and they not did for the thing itself, but they did for himself.
Leaders holds a position of power or authority, but those who lead inspire us. 

# Epiphany
- There are two types of law in this world: those that are made by a higher authority and those are made by men. And not until all the laws that are made by men are consistent with the laws made by a higher authority will we live in a just world.
- Know other people that can tell you what you really are, what you think about yourself are just illusions, you should think harder and analyze yourself.
- Apart of the former couple, you can couple with your mind with many others, that can stimulate yourself.

# Emapthy vs Sumpathy
Empathy fuels connection, instead Simpathy drives disconnection. Empathy has four qualities:
- Perspective taking, the ability to take the perspective of another person or recognise their perspective as their truth
- Staying out of judgement, not easy when enjoy it as much us do
- Recognising emotion of other people, then communicating that
- Empathy is feeling WITH people
-> Empathy good phrase is "I know what it's like down here and you are not alone"
-> Instead simphaty is "Uuuh, is bad? ah?"
Empathy is a choice, a vulnerable choice, because in order to connect I have to connect with something that knows that feeling.
Simpathy try to address the vulnerability trying to change the discourse or galvanize with the good part.
A good empathy person say "I don't even know how to say, but I am just glad that you told me"; because the thruth is rarely an answer make something better; what makes something better is connection.

# Buddhism, Zen, Stoicism, ...

I've been studying buddhism since August 2016. Quite by accident in fact, when I
came across *Fearless* by Brenda Shoshanna, whose heady mixture of modern
psychology and ancient buddhist wisdom acted as a gateway drug into a whole new
way of looking at my mind and the world.

In more recent times, I've also been studying ancient and modern stoic writings
and trying to experiment with putting these ideas into practice in my day to day
life.

## Finding Books

Many spiritual practices have been around for an exceedingly long time. This
works to your advantage in many ways. One such way is that your public library
will likely be a great resource for such books.

Your local library will have dozens of books on the subject, providing a near
endless source of free wisdom for the aspiring adventurer of the mind.

## Being Open

It cannot be overstated the importance of openness.

Expect nothing. This sounds bleak, but it's about the idea that when you don't
expect anything from other people or things, they will delight you over and over
again -- all without any disappointments.

Cherish people for their oddities and idiosyncracies. Don't hold them up to your
own set of values you live by: they aren't you.

See each of the world's disregards of your expectations as an opportunity, not a
cosmic insult. Learn to explore, not expect.

It took a long time for me to realize that people can tell the difference
between when you're open or closed. We can't connect with closed people. We
cannot connect with others when we are closed. Be open with others. Confidence
is borne from trust.
