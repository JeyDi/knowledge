# Vegetables

Vegetables are vital to a healthy diet.

Do you remember how, when you were a child, your parents wouldn’t let you leave the table until you’d finished all your veggies?

Well, all those leafy greens may have extended your life, since vegetables are on the front line of preventing life-threatening diseases.

In fact, whole vegetables, as opposed to processed ones, have been found to protect cellular telomeres – nucleotide “caps” that keep DNA healthy as cells divide and age. Not just that, but vegetables like broccoli and cabbage can aid liver and lung function while cutting the risk of lymphoma and prostate cancer.

Over ten days, a 2010 study fed longtime smokers 25 times more broccoli than is consumed by the average American. When tested after the tenth day, this group’s blood contained 41 percent fewer DNA mutations than that of the smokers who didn’t eat broccoli.

What about kale, also known as the “queen of greens”? Kale might even reduce cholesterol levels. There’s a 2008 study in which 30 men with high cholesterol drank three to four shots of kale juice daily for three months. The level of bad cholesterol in these subjects was dramatically reduced, while good cholesterol was raised by the equivalent of running 300 miles.

So, some vegetables are especially powerful, and others are pretty good for you too. Eating five servings of veggies a day is the magic solution. Out of these five, two should be leafy greens like kale, arugula and chard. One should be a cruciferous vegetable like broccoli, cabbage or cauliflower. And the other two should include carrots, beets and mushrooms.

Cruciferous vegetables are essential as they produce sulforaphane, a potentially powerful, anti-inflammatory, cancer-fighting molecule. These vegetables are best eaten raw since the enzyme that activates sulforaphane is destroyed by heat.

Chopping them up before cooking is fine, however, since doing so activates the enzyme, thereby forming sulforaphane. After just 40 minutes, the molecule is preserved, and the vegetable can be safely cooked.

Dark leafy greens are important since they contain the most nutrition per calorie of any food on earth. If you don’t like them, just try blending them into a fruit smoothie.
