# Salt intake and omega 3

Limit your salt intake and consume more omega-3 fatty acids to keep your body balanced.

Who doesn’t love a salty snack? Human bodies are actually drawn to salt consumption. Whether it’s potato chips or sardines, we’ve got our salty craving. And no kitchen is complete without table salt for seasoning. But for millions of years, human diets didn’t feature any added salt.

Although we need the sodium that table salt provides, too much salt can be incredibly harmful. Today, humans consume around 3,500 milligrams of salt each day. Yet, our ancestors tended to consume far less – around 600 to 800 milligrams per day. This increased intake is putting us at risk of stomach cancer, osteoporosis and heart attacks.

Studies show that there is a strong correlation between higher salt intake and high blood pressure. High blood pressure is the leading cause of 62 percent of strokes and 49 percent of coronary heart disease. Elderly people living in suburbs and cities often exhibit high blood pressure, while those living in rural or remote areas do not. Why? Because the latter group does not use extra salt in their diet.

While salt is one food that has a powerful negative impact on our bodies, there are foods with equally significant benefits. Take omega-3 fatty acids, for example. Though our bodies don’t produce these fatty acids themselves, we need them to lower inflammation, protect our brains and prevent cancer. So, we have to find it in the foods we eat.

From hemp and chia seeds to walnuts, fish and green vegetables, there are plenty of foods rich in these acids. Processed foods also contain fatty acids, but a kind that is less useful to our body.

It’s also a good idea to increase our omega-3 intake with the aid of supplements. While fish oil capsules are popular, it’s worth noting that they can contain toxic levels of mercury if improperly cleaned or stored. A safer option is high-quality supplements derived from algae grown indoors in a clean and controlled environment.

Reducing your salt intake and supplementing your diet with omega-3 fatty acids are just two of many ways to improve your health in the long run. So, if you aren’t feeling as fit as you’d like, take a look at your diet with these blinks in mind. It might be time to try out some new recipes!
