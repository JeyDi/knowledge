# Nuts and seeds
Nuts and seeds are super nutritious.

Did you know that a single daily serving of nuts or seeds can make all the difference in fighting disease?

The Global Burden of Disease Study carried out between 1990 and 2010 found that eating too few seeds and nuts was the third leading dietary risk for death and disability worldwide.

Consumption of nuts and seeds could save 2.5 million lives annually, and researchers have found that a single serving of brazil nuts is capable of lowering cholesterol levels even faster than statins!

Not just that, but the phytates found in nuts and seeds detoxify excess iron from the body, which can create free radicals linked to colorectal cancer. While phytates used to be considered inhibitors of mineral absorption, they’ve since been found to increase bone density.

And don’t worry about the calories. While nuts and seeds may be high in them, clinical studies have found no weight gain when these foods are added to a diet. The body likely fails to absorb some of this fat, and, in any case, nuts boost the body’s fat-burning metabolism.

So, nuts and seeds are great for you, and there are many to choose from. The most recommended seeds are chia, hemp, pumpkin, sesame and sunflower. A single serving is a quarter cup of straight seeds or two tablespoons of seed butter.

If you want other ways to incorporate nuts and seeds into your diet, try adding them to sauces and dressings. Just take tahini, a sesame seed paste that makes a rich addition to salad dressings. Or consider peanuts; while they’re technically a legume, most health studies lump them with other nuts. Peanut butter is a classic treat and a surefire way to get a kid to eat celery.

Regarding nuts proper, walnuts are the most nutritious. They’re even among the most antioxidizing foods and boast high levels of omega-3s.

Beyond that, pistachios can even serve as a substitute for Viagra! Studies have found that three to four handfuls of these tasty nuts can increase blood flow to the male genitalia, decreasing erectile dysfunction.
