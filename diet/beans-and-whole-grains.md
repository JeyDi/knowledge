# Beans and whole grains

Beans and whole grains are great for your health.

Beans get a bad rap for the, uh, unpleasant side effects they produce, but actually, they’re super nutritious. The American Institute for Cancer Research recommends eating a serving of beans or legumes with every meal since they offer an animal-free protein with added benefits, like fiber.

Soy is the most popular bean in America, but processed versions of soybeans, like tofu, should be avoided. Tempeh, young whole soybeans or other whole soy-based foods are better options.

And if you don’t like soy, no problem! Navy and pinto beans can lower bad cholesterol just as much as soy. Lentils are a good choice for legumes as they can cut a sugar spike, even hours after a meal. Beyond that, they’re loaded with prebiotics, can relax the stomach and slow the rate of sugar absorption.

If you’re pressed for time, canned beans are just as healthy as dried ones, with one exception: many makes of canned beans use large amounts of salt but rinsing the beans removes key nutrients along with the brine. That’s why it’s important to get sodium-free versions.

So, you should eat beans three times a day, and the same goes for whole grains, which can deter debilitating diseases. A 2015 analysis found that people who eat whole grains – whatever their other dietary habits – live longer lives.

Whole grains can cut the risk of heart disease, type-2 diabetes, obesity and even strokes. What’s even more exciting is that the healthiest ones are the most colorful, because the more color a grain contains, the higher its antioxidant content.

Now, you might be having nightmares about stodgy whole-wheat pasta, but new technology has improved its taste, and there’s nothing to fear. Even popcorn is a good choice as long it’s air popped, and you skip the butter.

And remember, packaged grain products that are labeled “multi-grain” or “stone-ground” are not whole grains. That’s why it’s important to check nutritional labels and confirm that the ratio of carbohydrates to fiber is five to one or lower.
