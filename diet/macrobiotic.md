## Macrobiotic Lifestyle Suggestions
* Eat only when hungry.
* Proper chewing (around 50 times or more per mouthful) is important for good digestion and assimilation of nutrients.
* Eat in an orderly and relaxed manner. When you eat, sit with a good posture and take a moment to express gratitude for the food.
* You may eat regularly two or three times per day, as much as you want, provided the proportion is generally correct and each mouthful is thoroughly chewed. It is best to leave the table satisfied but not full.
* Drink liquids moderately, only when thirsty.
* For the deepest and most restful sleep, retire before midnight and avoid eating at least 2 to 3 hours before sleeping.
* Wash as needed, but avoid long hot baths or showers which deplete the body of minerals.
* Use cosmetics and cleaning products that are made from natural, non-toxic ingredients. Avoid chemically-perfumed products. For care of the teeth, brush with natural toothpaste.
* As much as possible, wear cotton clothing, especially for undergarments. Avoid wearing synthetic or woolen clothing directly on the skin. Avoid wearing excessive accessories.
* Spend time outdoors if strength permits. Walk on the grass, beach, or soil for at least one half hour every day. Spend some time in direct sunlight daily.
* Exercise regularly. Activities may include walking, yoga, martial arts, dance, etc.
* Include some large green plants in the home to freshen and enrich the oxygen content of the air. Open windows daily to permit fresh air to circulate, even in cold weather.
* Keep your home in good order, especially the areas where food is prepared and served.
* To increase circulation and elimination of toxins, scrub the entire body with a hot, damp towel every morning or every night. If that is not possible, at least scrub the hands, feet, fingers and toes.
* Avoid using electric cooking devices (ovens and ranges) or microwave ovens. The use of a gas or wood stove is preferred.
* Use earthenware, cast iron, or stainless steel cookware rather than aluminum or Teflon-coated pots.
* Minimize the frequent use of television and computers. When using a computer, protect yourself from potentially harmful electromagnetic fields with a protective shield over the screen or other safety devices.
* Sing a happy song!
