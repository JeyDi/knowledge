## Herbs and spices

Herbs and spices make healthy foods even more beneficial.

Herbs and spices can add flare to a dish, but these fragrant flavorings are also powerful fighters of disease, especially cancer.

They contain the highest levels of antioxidants of all food groups. A bowl of whole wheat pasta, tomato sauce and broccoli contains 150 units of antioxidants. Add just a single teaspoon of oregano to the mix, and that number jumps to 300!

Or consider a 16-week study of Alzheimer’s patients in 2010. It found that participants who took saffron had much better cognitive function than those who received a placebo.

Beyond that, spices like cloves, cinnamon, oregano and nutmeg inhibit an enzyme known as monoamine oxidase, which can spark depression. This is great news since the drugs that do the same thing have serious potential side effects, like brain hemorrhages.

But of all the herbs and spices, turmeric is the best, especially for cancer. Turmeric contains curcumin, a molecule that gives the spice its deep yellow hue and seems to make it effective in the treatment of colon, lung and pancreatic cancer. A quarter teaspoon of the spice, dried or fresh, is recommended daily.

While turmeric is eliminated from the body quite quickly, simple black pepper can suppress this process. The proof here is in the curry. Turmeric and black pepper are core ingredients in Indian curry powder, which clearly has health benefits: American women have ten times the rate of colorectal cancer and 17 times the rate of lung cancer of their Indian counterparts.

That being said, turmeric supplements are best avoided. These capsules focus solely on curcumin, and there’s no proof that this molecule is the only disease-fighting derivative in turmeric.

And turmeric isn’t for everybody. People with gallstones and, to a lesser degree, those with kidney stones, should limit their intake. That’s because turmeric encourages the pumping action of the gallbladder, which can cause pain in sufferers. Beyond that, turmeric is rich in oxalates, which can play a role in the most common type of kidney stones.
