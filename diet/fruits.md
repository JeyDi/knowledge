# Fruits

A healthy diet should contain four servings of fruit a day, one of which should be berries. Keep in mind that means whole fruit and not fruit juice. Harvard research has found that drinking fruit juice correlates to a higher risk of type-2 diabetes because of its high ratio of sugar to fiber, whereas whole fruit has been correlated to a lower risk of the same condition.

Beyond that, eating fruit has been found to improve lung function. Just a single extra serving of fruit per day could result in a 24 percent decrease in the risk of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, or COPD. This is due to fruit’s rich antioxidant content, which limits cellular damage and reduces inflammation.

And don’t worry about the natural sugar in fruits causing weight gain. Only the fructose in added sugars is associated with health problems. The fiber, antioxidants and phytonutrients in fruit itself can combat the adverse effects of fructose. Natural sugar from fruit can even balance insulin spikes caused by foods with a high-glycemic index, like white bread.

So, fruit is great for you and berries are especially important. They’re known for their immune-boosting functions, their cancer-fighting abilities and ability to prevent diseases of the liver as well as the brain.

Take a 2014 study of 14 patients with hereditary colon polyps. After just nine months of eating black raspberries, the polyp load of these patients was halved.

Interestingly, this incredible antioxidizing power is believed to come from their pigmentation, and berries are second only to herbs and spices as the most antioxidant-rich foods, with an average of ten times more antioxidants than other fruits. For comparison, apples contain around 60 units of antioxidants, while a cup of blackberries contains 650!
