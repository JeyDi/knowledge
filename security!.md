Security is a broad topic.  Unless you have considerable experience, a security background, or are applying for a position that requires knowledge of security, you probably won't need to know more than the basics:

* Encrypt in transit and at rest.
* Sanitize all user inputs or any input parameters exposed to user to prevent [XSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) and [SQL injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection).
* Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
* Use the principle of [least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege).
