## Adaptive design

Adaptive websites adapt to the width of the browser at a specific points. In other words, the website is only concerned about the browser being a specific width, at which point it adapts the layout.

Adaptive design uses static layouts based on breakpoints which don’t respond once they’re initially loaded.

Adaptive is useful for retrofitting an existing site in order to make it more mobile friendly. This allows you to take control of the design and develop for specific, multiple viewports. The number of viewports that you choose to design for is entirely up to you, your company and overall budget. It does, however, afford you a certain amount of control (for example over content and layout) that you won’t necessarily have using responsive design.

Generally, you would begin by designing for a low resolution viewport and work your way up to ensure that the design doesn’t become constrained by the content.

As mentioned previously, it’s standard to design for six resolutions.  However, you can make a more informed decision by looking at your web analytics for the most commonly used devices and then designing for those viewports.

If you want to design an adaptive site from scratch, that’s OK too. Start again by designing for the lowest resolution and work your way up. You can then use media queries to expand the layout for higher resolution viewports. However, if you do design for multiple resolutions, you may find that this causes the layout to ‘jump’ when resizing a window.

It can be extra work designing and developing a site with adaptive for multiple viewports so it’s usually used for retrofitting.
