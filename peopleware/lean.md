- draws upon the knowledge of individuals
- shrinking of batch sizes
- just in time production and inventory control
- acceleration of cycle times

## Lean startup
A startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of uncertainty

## Lean UX
- Shared understanding: The more understanding, the less documentation, but this does not mean NO documentation. You need to do whatever is needed in order to gain a shared understanding
- Deep collaboration: Strong belief that ideas come from different voices. Trust is essential; all effort never stray far from collaborative effort. If we don't trust, we don't respect each other skills.
- Continuous customer feedback: this is the lifeboold of the team. You should gets rid of politics; a team should be outside-in, should make decision about what happen outside.
