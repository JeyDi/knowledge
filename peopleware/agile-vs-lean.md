##Â Agile versus Lean

### Outcome
* Agile has a working product at the end of each sprint
* Lean has a user testable experience at the end of each sprint. 

### Cadence
* Agile has 2 or 3 weeks sprint
* Lean starts with 1 week sprint, later moves to less frequent sprints

### Definition of done
* Agile: Pass acceptance criteria
* Lean: Learn something from the user

### Use of stories
* Agile: Stories feed the agile stream. A story is the unit of work
* Lean: Stories are much simpler, solution concepts replaces stories

### Planning tools
* Agile: utilizes tools to be able to manage backlog and stories
* Lean: no need for anything more complex than a simple list

### Working code
* Agile: yes
* Lean: UI bits yes; dev no simulated

### Focus
* Agile: engineering delivery
* Lean: experience learning

### Cerimonies
* Agile: full set of agile ceremonies, e.g. scrums, scrum of scrums, backlogs, grooming, planning, retrospectives, t-shirt sizing, etc.
* Lean: light on ceremonies: emphasis on as little process as possible, but has its own form of backlogs, planning, retrospectives

### Relantionship between them
* Lean feeds stories into the agile stream.
* UI agile stream is tightly coupled to lean ux stream.
* Loosely coupled to the dev streams.
