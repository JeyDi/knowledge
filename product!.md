# How to make a message
Explain why and how more than what.

# Law of diffusion of innovation
- 2.5% of popolation are innovators
- 13.5% of popolation are early adopters
- 34% of popolation are early majority
- 34% of popolation are late majority
- 16% of popolation are laggards (they innovate only if they have to)

This law is tellings us that if you want mass-market success or mass-market acceptance of an idea, 
you can not have it until you achieve the tipping point between 15% - 18% of population.
The majority of population will try something only if someone else is trying it.
And to convince early adopters and innovators we need to convince why they should do things in the way we explain it.
