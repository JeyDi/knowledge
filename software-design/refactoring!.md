Refactoring means changing the design of existing software. This reading list covers 4 different levels of software design granularity: Code Design, Component Design, Domain Design, and System Design. Refactoring at each level presents new challenges. Here is where to look for related discussions at each granularity level:
* Code Design: Clean Code discusses design, Refactoring discusses refactoring
* Component Design: Object Design discusses design, Refactoring to Patterns discusses refactoring
* Domain Design: Domain Driven Design discusses both design and refactoring
* System Design: Software Systems Architecture discusses design, and Michael Nygard’s talk Architecture Without an End State discusses refactoring

Time Allocation Heuristics:
* Deciding to refactor: Code Smells, Boy Scout Rule, 3 Strikes Rule (generalize or automate)
* Deciding not to refactor: Use Before Reuse, You Aren’t Gonna Need It (YAGNI), No Gold Plating, Perfect is the enemy of good/done
