Probability of A and B if A and B are not indipendent
P(A and B) = P(B given A) * P(A)

Probability of A and B if A and B are indipendent
P(A and B) = P(B) * P(A)
To be sure about indipendence we need to prove that P(B given A) = P(B)

Probability of A or B
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) if they are mutually esclusive and that means P(A and B) = 0
