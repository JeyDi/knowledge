How do I calculate my macros?
The absolute simplest, bare bones answer to this is:

Start with 0.8-1g/protein per pound that you weigh (if you are very overweight, use your target bodyweight instead) and shoot for this minimum every day
Fill in your remaining calories with however much carbs or fat that you want.
In more detail:

"Macros" is short for macronutrients. These include dietary carbohydrate, protein, and fat. Alcohol is a fourth macro, but it is not usually budgeted for on it own and its consumption typically comes at the expense of the carbohydrate allotment. Key to setting up your macro split is knowing your total calorie intake needs and the fact that protein and carbohydrates have ~4 Calories per gram, while fat contains ~9 Calories per gram. (Alcohol clocks in at ~7 Calories per gram.) While everyone will have different needs and preferences for their macronutrient breakdown, the following is a generic guide to get you started. We calculate macros from the ground up, but always in the context of total calorie intake.

Protein
Protein intake is the starting point. If calories are king, protein is queen. There is a large body of evidence emerging that shows adequate protein intake as a key element to achieving body weight and composition goals. (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)

One gram of protein per pound of body weight (1 g/lb) or 2.2 grams per kilogram (2.2 g/kg) is the traditional recommendation for protein intake. However, this can be considered the upper bound of target intake, with the suggested range spanning 0.45-1g/lb (1.0-2.2g/kg) of total body weight.

Fat
Fats are essential for many bodily functions including metabolism, brain function, and hormone production. For this reason, and despite decades of the low-fat dieting trend, fat calories are not "worse" than other calories. After your essential fatty acid needs are met in the diet, the remaining allocation for fat intake is largely determined by personal preference. A general rule of thumb and good starting point is 0.4g-0.5g/lb (0.9-1.1 g/kg) of total body weight.

Carbohydrate
Now that the essential macros have been calculated, we must refer back to the goal calorie intake to tie it all together. As such, the remaining allotment for carb intake is determined by subtracting your goal protein and fat intakes from your calorie intake. Basically, whatever caloric intake is left over after determining your protein and fat needs is met by carbohydrate consumption. So your goal carb intake in grams = [Goal calories - (Px4 + Fx9)] ÷ 4 where P and F are target grams of protein and fat, respectively. This result can range from 0.0-2.2g/lb (0-4.8g/kg) of total body weight and beyond depending on performance needs and personal preference.

To give an example of this process, let's look at a typical scenario: Billy is 22, 5'9 (175cm), and 175lb (79kg) and works out 3x/week. His estimated TDEE is 2450 but he wants to lose fat and gain muscle, so he is taking the advice given above and planning to consume 1890 calories daily. Using the suggestions above, Billy decides he should aim for 140g protein (0.8g/lb), 70g fat (0.4g/lb), and 175g carbs (1g/lb).

Remember that protein is the cornerstone of any macro split. Once you set your protein goal, the remaining allocation of fats and carbs is largely personal in nature. Given matched protein intakes, diets differing in fat and carb make-up do not perform any differently in terms of weight or composition changes. Don't be afraid to experiment with different intakes to find the set up that works best for your goals.

It's important to base your macro calculations on your own body stats - especially protein. Calculating macros as a percentage of calorie intake can create situations where some intakes are inadequate or overkill. Also, if you are significantly overweight, using your total body weight would be inappropriate for this activity and would heavily skew your macro split. In this instance, instead base your calculations on your lean body mass. Conversely, if you are significantly underweight, you may instead want to use your goal body weight.

How do I estimate the calories I'm eating?
tags: eating out, home cook

Now that you know all about macronutrients/caloric needs of the body, a question that's often asked is:
"I don't make my food, how do I calculate it?"
The reasons for this range from "I live at home/college/with an SO who is the cook" to "I live in hotels for work/am a food critic". Regardless, learning to estimate how much you're eating is a skill everyone should have.

Use a Calorie Counter's "Meal" function
Many sites from the resources section have pre-entered estimates from other users already in their respective databases. Use this until you feel comfortable with foods you know. Familiarity with sizes/numbers is the best way to learn how to estimate what you're eating.

Use "rule of thumb" charts
SparkPeople has the most well-known of these charts, but they are everywhere on the internet. The same basic concept is here as with using an actual calculator, but it doesn't require as much repitition to learn. You can even carry cheat sheets with you, or just leave them at work.

Use "real-life" objects as portion size estimators
It's much easier to estimate sizes if you have something to relate it to that you deal with every day. Whether that be an unrelated set of objects that you can visualise, or a set of objects you deal with every day, knowing that the meal the waiter just dropped in front of you is roughly 2 cups of potato and a pound of steak makes it much easier to either use your online calorie counter, or your rule of thumb.

 I have an injury, what should I do?
The following is general injury advice that you should be following until you can see an actual doctor. Light injury/strain/sprain should respond to this, and as always if the pain is not subsiding, a doctor should be your next step.

Joint Injuries

Joint injuries require lots of extra help. Joint mobility work is necessary and should be done every morning. This typically involves joint circles (except for the hinge joints: elbow, fingers, knees, etc. Never "circle" hinge joints). The best recommendation I've seen is to do a number of joint circles equal to your age, both clockwise and counterclockwise. If you have a popping or creaking joint, double this number. If it is painful, move slower and triple the number.

It may also help to put light pressure on the joints and work them out. For instance, doing standing pushups against a wall is a great way to help a shoulder injury. Doing "squats" while lying on your back will help a knee injury. The key is to move them, and put stress on them, but not a lot. Your body will respond to stress by making things stronger.

Muscular Injuries

RICE - Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation. Additionally, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are helpful to reduce pain and swelling.

As for applying ice, there are many recommended ways to do this, I will provide one: apply ice for 10 minutes, then no ice for 20 minutes, and repeat as often as possible. Ice causes a vasoconstriction. When you remove the ice the vasodilation brings fresh nutrient dense blood into the injury site to speed recovery. This is similar to contrast bathing. There is a good break down of how to implement RICE here.
