# Prime numbers

A number is prime if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. So for example 2, 3, 5, 79, 311 and 1931 are all prime, while 21 is not prime because it is divisible by 3 and 7. To find if a number n is prime we could simply check if it divides any numbers below it. We can use the modulus (%) operator to check for divisibility:

```
for (int i=2; i<n; i++)
   if (n%i==0) return false;

return true;
```

We can make this code run faster by noticing that we only need to check divisibility for values of i that are less or equal to the square root of n (call this m). If n divides a number that is greater than m then the result of that division will be some number less than m and thus n will also divide a number less or equal to m. Another optimization is to realize that there are no even primes greater than 2. Once weâ€™ve checked that n is not even we can safely increment the value of i by 2. We can now write the final method for checking whether a number is prime:

```
public boolean isPrime (int n)
{
   if (n<=1) return false;
   if (n==2) return true;
   if (n%2==0) return false;
   int m=Math.sqrt(n);

   for (int i=3; i<=m; i+=2)
      if (n%i==0)
         return false;

   return true;
}
```

Now suppose we wanted to find all the primes from 1 to 100000, then we would have to call the above method 100000 times. This would be very inefficient since we would be repeating the same calculations over and over again. In this situation it is best to use a method known as the Sieve of Eratosthenes. The Sieve of Eratosthenes will generate all the primes from 2 to a given number n. It begins by assuming that all numbers are prime. It then takes the first prime number and removes all of its multiples. It then applies the same method to the next prime number. This is continued until all numbers have been processed.

```
public boolean[] sieve(int n)
{
   boolean[] prime=new boolean[n+1];
   Arrays.fill(prime,true);
   prime[0]=false;
   prime[1]=false;
   int m=Math.sqrt(n);

   for (int i=2; i<=m; i++)
      if (prime[i])
         for (int k=i*i; k<=n; k+=i)
            prime[k]=false;

   return prime;
}
