- Big picture understanding: Are you a person who understands what the software is really about? Can you prioritize test cases properly?
- Knowing how the pieces fit togheter: Do you understand how software works, and how it might fit into a greater ecosystem?
- Organization: Do you approach the problem in a structured manner or do you just spiut off anything that comes to your head? A good candidate will break down the parts into categories and this also help you to do a more thorough job creating the test cases.
- Practicality: Can you actually create reasonable testing plans? Your testing plans need to be realistic and feasible for a company to implement.
