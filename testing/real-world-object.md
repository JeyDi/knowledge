How would test a pen? or another real world object?

1. Who will use it? And why?

You need to discuss with your interviewer who is using the product and for what purpose. The answer may not be what you think.

2. What are the use cases?

3. What are the bounds of use?

The bounds of use might mean holding up to thirty sheets of paper without damage. Other examples enviromental like warm, cold, etc..

4. What are the stress / failure conditions?

A good discussion to have is about when it's acceptable (or even necessary) for the product to fail, and what failure should mean.

5. How would you perform the testing?
