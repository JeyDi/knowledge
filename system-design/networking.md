## Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)

HTTP is a method for encoding and transporting data between a client and a server.  It is a request/response protocol: clients issue requests and servers issue responses with relevant content and completion status info about the request.  HTTP is self-contained, allowing requests and responses to flow through many intermediate routers and servers that perform load balancing, caching, encryption, and compression.

A basic HTTP request consists of a verb (method) and a resource (endpoint).  Below are common HTTP verbs:

| Verb | Description | Idempotent* | Safe | Cacheable |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | Reads a resource | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| POST | Creates a resource or trigger a process that handles data | No | No | Yes if response contains freshness info |
| PUT | Creates or replace a resource | Yes | No | No |
| PATCH | Partially updates a resource | No | No | Yes if response contains freshness info |
| DELETE | Deletes a resource | Yes | No | No |

*Can be called many times without different outcomes.

HTTP is an application layer protocol relying on lower-level protocols such as **TCP** and **UDP**.

## Transmission control protocol (TCP)

</p>

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol over an [IP network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol).  Connection is established and terminated using a [handshake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking).  All packets sent are guaranteed to reach the destination in the original order and without corruption through:

* Sequence numbers and [checksum fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol#Checksum_computation) for each packet
* [Acknowledgement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acknowledgement_(data_networks)) packets and automatic retransmission

If the sender does not receive a correct response, it will resend the packets.  If there are multiple timeouts, the connection is dropped.  TCP also implements [flow control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_control_(data)) and [congestion control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_congestion#Congestion_control).  These guarantees cause delays and generally result in less efficient transmission than UDP.

To ensure high throughput, web servers can keep a large number of TCP connections open, resulting in high memory usage.  It can be expensive to have a large number of open connections between web server threads and say, a [memcached](#memcached) server.  [Connection pooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_pool) can help in addition to switching to UDP where applicable.

TCP is useful for applications that require high reliability but are less time critical.  Some examples include web servers, database info, SMTP, FTP, and SSH.

Use TCP over UDP when:

* You need all of the data to arrive intact
* You want to automatically make a best estimate use of the network throughput

## User datagram protocol (UDP)

<p align="center">

</p>

UDP is connectionless.  Datagrams (analogous to packets) are guaranteed only at the datagram level.  Datagrams might reach their destination out of order or not at all.  UDP does not support congestion control.  Without the guarantees that TCP support, UDP is generally more efficient.

UDP can broadcast, sending datagrams to all devices on the subnet.  This is useful with [DHCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol) because the client has not yet received an IP address, thus preventing a way for TCP to stream without the IP address.

UDP is less reliable but works well in real time use cases such as VoIP, video chat, streaming, and realtime multiplayer games.

Use UDP over TCP when:

* You need the lowest latency
* Late data is worse than loss of data
* You want to implement your own error correction

## Remote procedure call (RPC)

</p>

In an RPC, a client causes a procedure to execute on a different address space, usually a remote server.  The procedure is coded as if it were a local procedure call, abstracting away the details of how to communicate with the server from the client program.  Remote calls are usually slower and less reliable than local calls so it is helpful to distinguish RPC calls from local calls.  Popular RPC frameworks include [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/), [Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/), and [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/).

RPC is a request-response protocol:

* **Client program** - Calls the client stub procedure.  The parameters are pushed onto the stack like a local procedure call.
* **Client stub procedure** - Marshals (packs) procedure id and arguments into a request message.
* **Client communication module** - OS sends the message from the client to the server.
* **Server communication module** - OS passes the incoming packets to the server stub procedure.
* **Server stub procedure** -  Unmarshalls the results, calls the server procedure matching the procedure id and passes the given arguments.
* The server response repeats the steps above in reverse order.

Sample RPC calls:

```
GET /someoperation?data=anId

POST /anotheroperation
{
  "data":"anId";
  "anotherdata": "another value"
}
```

RPC is focused on exposing behaviors.  RPCs are often used for performance reasons with internal communications, as you can hand-craft native calls to better fit your use cases.

Choose a native library (aka SDK) when:

* You know your target platform.
* You want to control how your "logic" is accessed.
* You want to control how error control happens off your library.
* Performance and end user experience is your primary concern.

HTTP APIs following **REST** tend to be used more often for public APIs.

## Disadvantage(s): RPC

* RPC clients become tightly coupled to the service implementation.
* A new API must be defined for every new operation or use case.
* It can be difficult to debug RPC.
* You might not be able to leverage existing technologies out of the box.  For example, it might require additional effort to ensure [RPC calls are properly cached](http://etherealbits.com/2012/12/debunking-the-myths-of-rpc-rest/) on caching servers such as [Squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/).

## Representational state transfer (REST)

REST is an architectural style enforcing a client/server model where the client acts on a set of resources managed by the server.  The server provides a representation of resources and actions that can either manipulate or get a new representation of resources.  All communication must be stateless and cacheable.

There are four qualities of a RESTful interface:

* **Identify resources (URI in HTTP)** - use the same URI regardless of any operation.
* **Change with representations (Verbs in HTTP)** - use verbs, headers, and body.
* **Self-descriptive error message (status response in HTTP)** - Use status codes, don't reinvent the wheel.
* **[HATEOAS](http://restcookbook.com/Basics/hateoas/) (HTML interface for HTTP)** - your web service should be fully accessible in a browser.

Sample REST calls:

```
GET /someresources/anId

PUT /someresources/anId
{"anotherdata": "another value"}
```

REST is focused on exposing data.  It minimizes the coupling between client/server and is often used for public HTTP APIs.  REST uses a more generic and uniform method of exposing resources through URIs, [representation through headers](https://github.com/for-GET/know-your-http-well/blob/master/headers.md), and actions through verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH.  Being stateless, REST is great for horizontal scaling and partitioning.

## Disadvantage(s): REST

* With REST being focused on exposing data, it might not be a good fit if resources are not naturally organized or accessed in a simple hierarchy.  For example, returning all updated records from the past hour matching a particular set of events is not easily expressed as a path.  With REST, it is likely to be implemented with a combination of URI path, query parameters, and possibly the request body.
* REST typically relies on a few verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH) which sometimes doesn't fit your use case.  For example, moving expired documents to the archive folder might not cleanly fit within these verbs.
* Fetching complicated resources with nested hierarchies requires multiple round trips between the client and server to render single views, e.g. fetching content of a blog entry and the comments on that entry. For mobile applications operating in variable network conditions, these multiple roundtrips are highly undesirable.
* Over time, more fields might be added to an API response and older clients will receive all new data fields, even those that they do not need, as a result, it bloats the payload size and leads to larger latencies.

## RPC and REST calls comparison

| Operation | RPC | REST |
|---|---|---|
| Signup	| **POST** /signup | **POST** /persons |
| Resign	| **POST** /resign<br/>{<br/>"personid": "1234"<br/>} | **DELETE** /persons/1234 |
| Read a person | **GET** /readPerson?personid=1234 | **GET** /persons/1234 |
| Read a personâ€™s items list | **GET** /readUsersItemsList?personid=1234 | **GET** /persons/1234/items |
| Add an item to a personâ€™s items | **POST** /addItemToUsersItemsList<br/>{<br/>"personid": "1234";<br/>"itemid": "456"<br/>} | **POST** /persons/1234/items<br/>{<br/>"itemid": "456"<br/>} |
| Update an item	| **POST** /modifyItem<br/>{<br/>"itemid": "456";<br/>"key": "value"<br/>} | **PUT** /items/456<br/>{<br/>"key": "value"<br/>} |
| Delete an item | **POST** /removeItem<br/>{<br/>"itemid": "456"<br/>} | **DELETE** /items/456 |

## Stack of the protocol
- Ajax -> Stateful
- HTTP -> Stateless
- TCP -> Sessionful
- IP -> Sessionless

## Other
- NAT: NAT stands for network address translation. 
It is a way to translate requests that are incoming into a routing server to the relevant devices or servers that it 
knows about in the LAN. This is usually implemented in physical LANs as a way to route requests through one IP address 
to the necessary backend servers.
- VPN: VPN stands for virtual private network. It is a means of connecting separate LANs through the internet, while 
maintaining privacy. This is used as a means of connecting remote systems as if they were on a local network, often 
for security reasons.

## OSI Model

Historically, one method of talking about the different layers of network communication is the OSI model. OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnect.

This model defines seven separate layers. The layers in this model are:
- Application: The application layer is the layer that the users and user-applications most often interact with. Network communication is discussed in terms of availability of resources, partners to communicate with, and data synchronization.
- Presentation: The presentation layer is responsible for mapping resources and creating context. It is used to translate lower level networking data into data that applications expect to see.
- Session: The session layer is a connection handler. It creates, maintains, and destroys connections between nodes in a persistent way.
- Transport: The transport layer is responsible for handing the layers above it a reliable connection. In this context, reliable refers to the ability to verify that a piece of data was received intact at the other end of the connection.
- This layer can resend information that has been dropped or corrupted and can acknowledge the receipt of data to remote computers.
- Network: The network layer is used to route data between different nodes on the network. It uses addresses to be able to tell which computer to send information to. This layer can also break apart larger messages into smaller chunks to be reassembled on the opposite end.
- Data Link: This layer is implemented as a method of establishing and maintaining reliable links between different nodes or devices on a network using existing physical connections.
- Physical: The physical layer is responsible for handling the actual physical devices that are used to make a connection. This layer involves the bare software that manages physical connections as well as the hardware itself (like Ethernet).

As you can see, there are many different layers that can be discussed based on their proximity to bare hardware and the functionality that they provide.

TCP/IP Model

The TCP/IP model, more commonly known as the Internet protocol suite, is another layering model that is simpler and has been widely adopted. It defines the four separate layers, some of which overlap with the OSI model:

Application: In this model, the application layer is responsible for creating and transmitting user data between applications. The applications can be on remote systems, and should appear to operate as if locally to the end user.
The communication is said to take place between peers.

Transport: The transport layer is responsible for communication between processes. This level of networking utilizes ports to address different services. It can build up unreliable or reliable connections depending on the type of protocol used.

Internet: The internet layer is used to transport data from node to node in a network. This layer is aware of the endpoints of the connections, but does not worry about the actual connection needed to get from one place to another. IP addresses are defined in this layer as a way of reaching remote systems in an addressable manner.

Link: The link layer implements the actual topology of the local network that allows the internet layer to present an addressable interface. It establishes connections between neighboring nodes to send data.

As you can see, the TCP/IP model, is a bit more abstract and fluid. This made it easier to implement and allowed it to become the dominant way that networking layers are categorized.

Interfaces
Interfaces are networking communication points for your computer. Each interface is associated with a physical or virtual networking device.

Typically, your server will have one configurable network interface for each Ethernet or wireless internet card you have.

In addition, it will define a virtual network interface called the "loopback" or localhost interface. This is used as an interface to connect applications and processes on a single computer to other applications and processes. You can see this referenced as the "lo" interface in many tools.

Many times, administrators configure one interface to service traffic to the internet and another interface for a LAN or private network.

In DigitalOcean, in datacenters with private networking enabled, your VPS will have two networking interfaces (in addition to the local interface). The "eth0" interface will be configured to handle traffic from the internet, while the "eth1" interface will operate to communicate with the private network.

Protocols
Networking works by piggybacking a number of different protocols on top of each other. In this way, one piece of data can be transmitted using multiple protocols encapsulated within one another.

We will talk about some of the more common protocols that you may come across and attempt to explain the difference, as well as give context as to what part of the process they are involved with.

We will start with protocols implemented on the lower networking layers and work our way up to protocols with higher abstraction.

Media Access Control

Media access control is a communications protocol that is used to distinguish specific devices. Each device is supposed to get a unique MAC address during the manufacturing process that differentiates it from every other device on the internet.

Addressing hardware by the MAC address allows you to reference a device by a unique value even when the software on top may change the name for that specific device during operation.

Media access control is one of the only protocols from the link layer that you are likely to interact with on a regular basis.

IP

The IP protocol is one of the fundamental protocols that allow the internet to work. IP addresses are unique on each network and they allow machines to address each other across a network. It is implemented on the internet layer in the IP/TCP model.

Networks can be linked together, but traffic must be routed when crossing network boundaries. This protocol assumes an unreliable network and multiple paths to the same destination that it can dynamically change between.

There are a number of different implementations of the protocol. The most common implementation today is IPv4, although IPv6 is growing in popularity as an alternative due to the scarcity of IPv4 addresses available and improvements in the protocols capabilities.

ICMP

ICMP stands for internet control message protocol. It is used to send messages between devices to indicate the availability or error conditions. These packets are used in a variety of network diagnostic tools, such as ping and traceroute.

Usually ICMP packets are transmitted when a packet of a different kind meets some kind of a problem. Basically, they are used as a feedback mechanism for network communications.

TCP

TCP stands for transmission control protocol. It is implemented in the transport layer of the IP/TCP model and is used to establish reliable connections.

TCP is one of the protocols that encapsulates data into packets. It then transfers these to the remote end of the connection using the methods available on the lower layers. On the other end, it can check for errors, request certain pieces to be resent, and reassemble the information into one logical piece to send to the application layer.

The protocol builds up a connection prior to data transfer using a system called a three-way handshake. This is a way for the two ends of the communication to acknowledge the request and agree upon a method of ensuring data reliability.

After the data has been sent, the connection is torn down using a similar four-way handshake.

TCP is the protocol of choice for many of the most popular uses for the internet, including WWW, FTP, SSH, and email. It is safe to say that the internet we know today would not be here without TCP.

UDP

UDP stands for user datagram protocol. It is a popular companion protocol to TCP and is also implemented in the transport layer.

The fundamental difference between UDP and TCP is that UDP offers unreliable data transfer. It does not verify that data has been received on the other end of the connection. This might sound like a bad thing, and for many purposes, it is. However, it is also extremely important for some functions.

Because it is not required to wait for confirmation that the data was received and forced to resend data, UDP is much faster than TCP. It does not establish a connection with the remote host, it simply fires off the data to that host and doesn't care if it is accepted or not.

Because it is a simple transaction, it is useful for simple communications like querying for network resources. It also doesn't maintain a state, which makes it great for transmitting data from one machine to many real-time clients. This makes it ideal for VOIP, games, and other applications that cannot afford delays.

HTTP

HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol. It is a protocol defined in the application layer that forms the basis for communication on the web.

HTTP defines a number of functions that tell the remote system what you are requesting. For instance, GET, POST, and DELETE all interact with the requested data in a different way.

FTP

FTP stands for file transfer protocol. It is also in the application layer and provides a way of transferring complete files from one host to another.

It is inherently insecure, so it is not recommended for any externally facing network unless it is implemented as a public, download-only resource.

DNS

DNS stands for domain name system. It is an application layer protocol used to provide a human-friendly naming mechanism for internet resources. It is what ties a domain name to an IP address and allows you to access sites by name in your browser.

SSH

SSH stands for secure shell. It is an encrypted protocol implemented in the application layer that can be used to communicate with a remote server in a secure way. Many additional technologies are built around this protocol because of its end-to-end encryption and ubiquity.

There are many other protocols that we haven't covered that are equally important. However, this should give you a good overview of some of the fundamental technologies that make the internet and networking possible.
