## Backtracking
This technique may be used in many types of problems. Just take a look at the limits (N, M and other main parameters). They serve as the main hint of a backtrack problem. If these are very small and you haven’t found a solution that’s easier to implement – then just don’t waste your time on searching it and implement a straight-forward backtracking solution.

Problem hints:
- You need to find all possible situations (positions) that satisfy a certain rule (threatens all given pieces).
- The limits are low.
