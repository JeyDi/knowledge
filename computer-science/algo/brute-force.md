## Brute force
There are many problems that can be solved by the help of a simple brute force. Note that the limits must not be high. How does a brute force algorithm work? Actually, it tries all possible situations and selects the best one. It’s simple to construct and usually simple to implement. If there is a problem that asks to enumerate or find all possible ways (situations) of doing a certain thing, and that doesn’t have high limits – then it’s most probably a brute force problem.

Problem hints:
- You need to find all possible situations (positions) that satisfy a certain rule.
- The limits are very low.
