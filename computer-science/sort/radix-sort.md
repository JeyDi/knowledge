Radix sort is a sorting algorithm for integers (and some other data types) that takes advantage the fact that integer have a finite number of bits. In radix sort, we iterate through each digit of a number, grouping by digits. E.g. with sort all number for the first bit, after the second and so on until the array is  sorted.
