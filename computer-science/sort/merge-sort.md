A comparison based sorting algorithm
- Divides entire dataset into groups of at most two.
- Compares each number one at a time, moving the smallest number to left of the pair.
- Once all pairs sorted it then compares left most elements of the two leftmost pairs creating a sorted group of four with the smallest numbers on the left and the largest ones on the right.
- This process is repeated until there is only one set.

What you need to know:
- This is one of the most basic sorting algorithms.
- Know that it divides all the data into as small possible sets then compares them.

Big O efficiency:
- Best Case Sort: Merge Sort: O(n)
- Average Case Sort: Merge Sort: O(n log n)
- Worst Case Sort: Merge Sort: O(n log n)

Merge Sort Vs. Quicksort
- Quicksort is likely faster in practice.
- Merge Sort divides the set into the smallest possible groups immediately then reconstructs the incrementally as it sorts the groupings.
- Quicksort continually divides the set by the average, until the set is recursively sorted.
