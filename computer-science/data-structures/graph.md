Implementation in javascript inspired by [itsy-bitsy-data-structures](https://github.com/thejameskyle/itsy-bitsy-data-structures).

```javascript

class Graph {

  constructor() {
    this.nodes = [];
  }

  /**
   * We can start to add values to our graph by creating nodes without any
   * lines.
   */

  addNode(value) {
    return this.nodes.push({ value, lines: [] });
  }

  /**
   * Next we need to be able to lookup nodes in the graph. Most of the time
   * you'd have another data structure on top of a graph in order to make
   * searching faster.
   *
   * But for our case we're simply going to search through all of nodes to find
   * the one with the matching value. This is a slower option, but it works for
   * now.
   */

  find(value) {
    return this.nodes.find(node => {
      return node.value === value;
    });
  }

  /**
   * Next we can connect two nodes by making a "line" from one to the other.
   */

  addLine(startValue, endValue) {
    // Find the nodes for each value.
    let startNode = this.find(startValue);
    let endNode = this.find(endValue);

    // Freak out if we didn't find one or the other.
    if (!startNode || !endNode) {
      throw new Error('Both nodes need to exist');
    }

    // And add a reference to the endNode from the startNode.
    startNode.lines.push(endNode);
  }
}
```

Finally you can use a graph like this:

```
var graph = new Graph();
    graph.addNode(1);
    graph.addNode(2);
    graph.addLine(1, 2);
    var two = graph.find(1).lines[0];
```

There are 2 basic ways to represent a graph in memory:
- adjacency matrix (or map)
- adjacency list

Time Complexities in case of Adjacency Matrix :
Traversal :(By BFS or DFS) O(V^2)
Space : O(V^2)

Time Complexities in case of Adjacency List :
Traversal :(By BFS or DFS) O(ElogV)
Space : O(V+E)
