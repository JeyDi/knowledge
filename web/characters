## ASCII
128 characters -> 7 bit

## Unicode
In Unicode, a letter maps to something called a code point which is still just a theoretical concept.
How that code point is represented in memory or on disk is a whole nuther story.
Every platonic letter in every alphabet is assigned a magic number by the Unicode consortium which is
written like this: U+0639.  This magic number is called a code point.
The U+ means “Unicode” and the numbers are hexadecimal. U+0639 is the Arabic letter Ain. 
The English letter A would be U+0041. You can find them all using the charmap utility on Windows 2000/XP 
or visiting the Unicode web site.

## Encodings
UTF-8 etc..
