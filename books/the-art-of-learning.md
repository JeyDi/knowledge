# The Art of Learning

## Two Mindsets
There are two mindsets of intelligence: “entity” and “incremental.” Many people are raised to believe 
the entity theory of intelligence, which is the belief that skill is an “ingrained and unalterable level of ability.”
They use language like, “I’m a good writer,” or “I’m bad at math.”

In contrast, people who have internalized the incremental theory of intelligence say things like, 
“I did well because I put in the time,” or “I should have worked harder at this.”
They understand that any concept can be grasped and mastered incrementally.

When children associate success with effort, they develop what Waitzkin calls a “mastery-oriented response.”
Children who see themselves as smart, dumb, good, or bad have a “learned helplessness orientation.”

Well-intentioned parents often set their children up for failure by telling them things like, “You’re so good at reading!”
or, “It’s OK, math just isn’t your thing.” The child implicitly learns to link success and failure with ingrained ability.

## Three foundational components of excellence
* First, world class performance requires that the individual develop a style that expresses the core of their being.
* Secondly, there is a delicate interaction between celebrating success and falling prey to a results-oriented mindset.
Someone who cares only about winning is setting themselves up for failure. However, this is not an excuse to pretend you
don’t care about the results and avoid challenging yourself; short-term goals and competition are useful and necessary
tools. There is nothing wrong with enjoying a win, so long as the spotlight is kept on the process.
Puts it beautifully: “When we have worked hard and succeed at something, we should be allowed to smell the roses.
The key is to recognize that the beauty of those roses lies in their transience.”
* Third point about excellence is similarly pithy: “Growth comes at the point of resistance.” The success comes when we are in
a constant state of leaping into the unknown, residing daily at the point of resistance. Of course, portions of the learning 
process will also be characterized by plateaus, when you are internalizing the information necessary for the next leap. 
Learning is a cycle between these two points, and stagnating at the midpoint leads only to mediocrity.

## The Structure of learning
The structure of the learning process so far has been this:
* Develop a solid grasp of the fundamentals
* Expand and refine your skills, guided by your individual disposition, while keeping in touch with the core of your discipline

## Emotions
A better way to deal with emotions is to acknowledge them and use them. To walk a thorny road, you don’t need to pave the entire road; just make sandals.
Elite performers “use emotion, observing their moment and then channeling everything into a deeper focus that generates a uniquely flavored creativity.
This is an interesting, resilient approach based on flexibility and subtle introspective awareness.”
Recall the three steps necessary to develop elite performance:
* Flowing with distraction
* Using the distraction as inspiration
* Learning to re-create those situations without the external distraction

To flow with emotions, we first have to acknowledge where they are coming from.

## Bringing It All Together
"The greatest of artists and competitors are masters of navigating their own psychologies, playing on their strengths,
controlling the tone of battle so that it fits with their personalities… The real art of learning takes place as we move
beyond proficiency, when our work becomes an expression of our essence."

Champions have mastered the technical so fully that their entire game consists of freely flowing intuition.
Those who progress even further are able to create a feedback loop by which they observe the results of the
intuition in order to deconstruct it with their conscious mind and deliver improved instructions to their subconscious.
(Elon Musk calls this “the single best piece of advice”: “having a feedback loop, where you’re constantly thinking about
what you’ve done and how you could be doing it better.”)

The processes that lead to this condition are complex and fluid, and The Art of Learning has accordingly been weaving
those concepts in and out of each chapter. If your head is spinning at this point (as mine was), you’ll probably appreciate
a conversion of the third step of the learning process into a high-level checklist format:
1. Lay a solid foundation by studying positions of reduced complexity.
2. Apply those principles to increasingly complex situations.
3. Make smaller circles: Take a single technique and practice it until you feel its essence, then condense it incrementally while maintaining its full effectiveness.
4. Slow down time: Focus on a group of techniques to build “chunks” that allow your subconscious mind to take over, allowing your conscious mind to hone in with tremendous precision.
5. Use your ability to make smaller circles and slow down time to leverage nuances unseen by others to control the intention of your opponent.
6. Once you understand the process, apply it to other areas.
