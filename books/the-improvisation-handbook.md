into slurry. If this is good-natured slurry, then the audience may still be charmed, and if it’s funny then so much the better, but this is guaranteed to provide nothing that the audience will remember the next day. Worse, the improvisers may be seduced into believing that the fact that they are improvising gives them a “free pass” from the audience, that the audience has no expectation of intelligence, story, character, logic or even coherence because “it’s just improv.”

## How to improvise

We also tend to punish ourselves after we do things. Two adults will volunteer for something, and after they finish they’ll make a physical gesture of apology which says to the room: “No need to mention it—we know it wasn’t very good.” Maybe this is because we teach our children to punish themselves if they suspect they’ve failed. When you’re a kid, if you’re washing dishes and you break a plate and you say “Well, never mind, everyone drops things from time to time,” and you clean it up in a relaxed and happy fashion, your mother will shout at you.

There is less shame in failing at something you are ill-equipped to do, so by making themselves seem not up to the task, they absolve themselves of the failure they “know” is coming. Despite the fact that they are pretty much guaranteeing failure by their own actions, they take a large degree of comfort from the fact that the failure is under their control. The safety of a certain failure is more rewarding than the possibility of success.
