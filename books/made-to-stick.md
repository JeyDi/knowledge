# Made to Stick: Why some ideas survive and others die

## Introduction
The main problem is the "Curse of Knowledge": The person sharing the idea has all sorts of insider information that
others don't, so they have already framed the problem and understand its relevance.
A single example illustrates the essence of the problem: One study tested a "tapper and listeners" game: They
asked a person to tap out the rhythm of a song and have another recognize it: the listener nearly always failed 
to identify the song.
What happened, of course, is that the tapper sings the song in their head and thus thinks he has the right rhythm,
but the person hearing the taps cannot hear the song inside the others head and therefore has no idea of what the
taps mean.

## Find the core
Determine the single most important thing, being careful not to bury the lead. The military uses a "Commander
Intent" instead of a plan. For example, rather than details on how to take a bridge, the CI might be "take the bridge." 
Use the technique of the inverted pyramid from journalism: Tell most important aspect first, then tailor, then add
details. This forces prioritization.

## Share the core
The key to motivating others with your ideas is to use the core message to help them make decisions as they apply your
idea. The essential part is to make the message compact and to have it imply a sense of worth or priorities about how
to implement it. (Or, to put it another way it needs to be both compact and profound.)
For example, a newspaper editor liked to have his paper strongly - and only - reflect local issues. He had a motto of
"names, names, and names." Note how this guides the individual decisions made by his reporters.

## Unexpected
The first requirement of effective communication is getting
attention, the second is
keeping it.
So, a good process for making ideas sticker is:

1) Identify the central message you need to communicate -- find the core;
2) Figure out what is counterintuitive about the message -- i.e., What are the unexpected implications of your core
message? Why isn't it already happening naturally?
3) Communicate your message in a way that breaks your audience's guessing machines along the critical, counter-intuitive
dimension. Then, once their guessing machines have failed, help them refine their machines.
