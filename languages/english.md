Here's A Tip
When we want to talk about where something / someone is located, we can use prepositions of place.

We’re going to learn a few basic ones in this unit. Have a look at some examples below.

We are at the station.
They live near the city centre.
My hometown is not far from London.
We normally use "in" with towns, cities and countries.

He lives in Liverpool.
Now they live in Brazil.
She is in Australia this week.
We use "at" with a specific or exact location.

I am at the entrance.
He is at his desk.
They are at the restaurant.
Let's have another look at all the prepositions of place we've learnt:

# Can, could, may
Vocabulary
can

Can I book a table for four, please?
can
Can I book a table for four, please?
could

Could I have some water please?
could
Could I have some water please?
may

May we order?
may
May we order?
Here's A Tip
In this unit we will look at the words "can", "could" and "may". We use these words when we ask for something.

Can you help me?
May I have the bill, please?
Could we have a jug of water, please?
"Could", "can" and "may" remain the same with all personal pronouns.

May / Can / Could I...?
May / Can / Could he/she...?
May / Can / Could we...?
When we are making requests, “may” relates to permission, while “could” and "can" relate to possibility. However, in most spoken contexts, you can use all three.

"Can" = polite/informal
"Could" = more polite/more formal
"May" = most polite/most formal
When we make requests, we always put “can”, “could”, or “may” at the beginning.

Can we order some food, please?
Could they have a table by the window?

# Quantifier
Quantifiers allow us to talk about large and small quantities of nouns. To talk about large quantities of nouns, we can use "lots of" or "a lot of". Both are use for countable and uncountable nouns, and so are interchangeable.

There are lots of good bars in town.
There's a lot of fruit in the kitchen.
There's lots of chocolate.
To talk about small quantities of countable nouns, we use "not many". To talk about small quantities of uncountable nouns, we use "not much". These are not interchangeable.

There aren't many shops in town.
There isn't much pasta.
We can also use quantifiers when asking questions about quantity. To do this, we use "how many" with countable nouns and "how much" with uncountable nouns.

How much cheese is there?
How many bars are there in town?
How much juice do we have?
How many vegetables do you want?
Countable	Uncountable
lots of / a lot of	lots of / a lot of
not many	not much
How many... ?	How much... ?

# This, that, these, those
We use "this", "that", "these" and "those" to talk about specific objects / people. First let's focus on "this" and "that". "This" refers to something that is nearby, and "that" usually refers to something that is further away.

We use "these" and "those" to refer to groups of objects or people. . "These" refers to things that are nearby, and "those" refers to things that are further away.

They help us give the time at which something happens.

I get up at 6 a.m. every morning.
On my birthday we usually go to a restaurant.
It rains a lot in autumn.
We use the preposition "at" to discuss clock times, holidays and other specific time frames.

at 5 o'clock
at Christmas, at Easter
at the moment
at night, at the weekend
We also say "at breakfast", "at lunch" and "at dinner".

I'm busy at breakfast but I'm free at lunch.
We use the preposition "on" with days of the week or any specific dates.

My birthday is on the 5th of October.
My interview is on Monday at 11 a.m.
We use the preposition "in" with months, seasons, years and longer periods of time.

in December / in June
in spring / in summer / in autumn / in winter
in 2006
We also say "in the past" and "in the future".

# Adjectives and adverbs

Vocabulary
nice

new

Your new kitchen is very modern.
new

beautiful

Her garden is so beautiful.
beautiful
Her garden is so beautiful.
Here's A Tip
We've just learnt how to talk about the place you live in using words such as "old" and "modern". We call these words "adjectives". They help us to describe people and objects in more detail. Have a look at some other examples below.

I live in a nice house.
My flat is very cosy.
We can use adverbs along with adjectives if we want to give more information about something. Adverbs modify an adjective's meaning and can also give emphasis. Have a look at some of them highlighted below.

They live in a very big apartment.
This house is really modern.
Your kitchen is so cosy.
You can also use the adverb "pretty". It has a a similar meaning to "quite", but is more informal.

Michael's apartment is very big.
Wow! Your flat is quite big, Michael.
"Really" and "very" are similar in meaning. Have a look at the example below.

Your living room is really modern.
Our house is very old.
Have you noticed that adverbs normally go before the adjectives? Look at the structure and examples below.

adverb + adjective + object / subject
We work in a really + modern + office.
They live in a very + big + flat.
Let's learn a couple of other adjectives that will help you to describe your objects even better.

Your new kitchen is very modern.
Elisa's garden is so beautiful.
Did you notice that the adverb "quite" and the adjective "quiet" are spelt similarly? Be careful and try to remember how to spell both words correctly!

My bedroom is quite small.
It is so quiet in here.
Dialogue
Margaret: Mike! How is your new flat?

Margaret: Mike! How is your new flat?

Michael: It's really nice, thanks.

Michael: It's really nice, thanks.

Margaret: What is it like?

Margaret: What is it like?

Michael: Well it's very modern, but the living room is quite cosy.

Michael: Well it's very modern, but the living room is quite cosy.

Margaret: Oh good. That part of town is so beautiful, too.

Margaret: Oh good. That part of town is so beautiful, too.

# Present continuous

Here's A Tip
We're now going to learn how to use the present continuous. We use this tense to talk about temporary actions and things that are happening at the time of speaking, like in the examples below.

I'm looking for my wallet.
They're working from home today.
To recap: we use the present simple to talk about things that are generally true, or that occur regularly.

We use the present continuous to talk about temporary actions or things that are happening at the time of speaking.

Present simple: I work from home every Tuesday.
Present continuous: I'm working from home at the moment.
We form the present continuous like this:

form of "to be" + verb + "ing"

He is cooking dinner for his partner.
They are going to the supermarket.
Infinitive	Grammar: Present continuous
to have	having
to live	living
to close	closing
We form negatives in the present continuous like this:

form of "to be" + "not" + verb + "ing"

I'm not having a great time. Can we go home?
He's not reading a book at the moment.
We're not cooking this evening. We're going out for dinner!
When we form questions in the present continuous, we simply take the verb and place it at the beginning of the sentence, like this:

He is having the lasagne. - Is he having the lasagne?
They're studying medicine at university. - Are they studying medicine at university?
Don't forget, when we use verbs that normally end in an "e" in the present continuous, we remove the "e" before we add the "ing".

Dialogue
Hannah: What are you doing today, Lucas?

Hannah: What are you doing today, Lucas?

Lucas: I'm just going to the supermarket. Let's have dinner together later!

Lucas: I'm just going to the supermarket. Let's have dinner together later!

Hannah: That sounds great. Do you want to go out for dinner or cook?

Hannah: That sounds great. Do you want to go out for dinner or cook?

Lucas: I'm really enjoying cooking, at the moment. Let's do that. What are you doing?

Lucas: I'm really enjoying cooking, at the moment. Let's do that. What are you doing?

Hannah: I'm just opening the shop. I should go actually. See you later!

Hannah: I'm just opening the shop. I should go actually. See you later!

# What, where, when..
Who - to ask about a person / people
When - to ask about a time
Where - to ask about a place
Why - to ask about a reason
What - to ask about a thing / specific information

# Past simple - The verb "to be"
Here's A Tip
Now we’re going to learn to talk about things that happened in the past. To do that, we need a new tense: the past simple (the past simple). For now, we’re just going to learn the past simple form of the verb “to be”.

- How was your day?
- Uff, it was very stressful.
Personal pronoun	"To be" in the past
I	was
he / she	was
it	was
you	were
we	were
they	were
To form a question, we change the word order in the sentence by placing the verb "to be" at the beginning. If there is a question word, we put it before the verb.

What / Why / Where / When / How

+

was / were

+

subject (personal pronoun / noun) ...?

Were you late this morning?
How was your evening?
To make the statement negative, we add "not" after "was" or "were". In speech, we usually shorten it using an apostrophe.

It was not late. = It wasn't late.
He was not busy. = He wasn't busy.
You were not tired. = You weren't tired.
Positive statement	Negative statement	Question
I was	I wasn't	Was I ...?
He / She was	He / She wasn't	Was he / she ...?
It was	It wasn't	Was it ...?
You were	You weren't	Were you ...?
We were	We weren't	Were we ...?
They were	They weren't	Were they ...?
When we talk about actions in the past we often add time phrases to give more information about when the action happened.

yesterday
last night / summer / year
ages ago
in 2006

# Talking about future events
Here's A Tip
Did you know? In English, we can use the present simple or the present continuous to talk about plans for the future.

Look at the sentences below. They are all talking / asking about future plans.

What are you doing at the weekend?
Tomorrow we're going to the theatre.
I fly on May 1st.
That’s not to say that we don’t have future tenses in English... we do!

But it's very common amongst natives to talk about the future using present tenses (even more common than using a future tense!)

What are you doing at the weekend? - Very natural
There is a very subtle difference between using the present simple and using the present continuous for future events. Here's a brief summary.

Present continuous: Future plans agreed between friends / family
We are meeting Michael and Angela at the restaurant.
Present simple: Pre-scheduled / pre-organised future events.
My train leaves tomorrow at 3.30.
The meeting is on Monday.

# Phrasal verbs
A phrasal verb is formed of two words: usually a 'base' verb, followed by another short word. Sometimes this changes the meaning of the original verb.

meet > meet + up
catch > catch + up
go > go + out
In all of these cases, the two words stay next to eachother.

Shall we eat in tonight?
Let's meet up!
Some verbs can be followed by many different words to create different meanings.

go: about, away, off, on, out, over...
let: down, in, off, out...
take: away, back, down, in...

# Past simple
Here's A Tip
We use the past simple tense to talk about completed actions in the past. It is often used with expressions of time:

I failed my Maths exam last year.
I wrote two essays last week.
Yesterday, he sat an exam.
"To form the Past simple with regular verbs, we add the ending -ed. If the regular verb already ends in 'e', we just add -d. If the regular ends in 'y', remove it and add -ied."

listen > I listened, you listened he / she listened
revise > we revised, you (pl) revised, they revised
study > I studied, you studied
Irregular verbs do not have a standard ending in the Past simple. Instead, we have to learn each verb individually. Here are a few

go > I went, you went, he / she went
make > we made, you (pl) made, they made
write > I wrote, you wrote
read > he / she read
understand > we understood
Note the difference in pronunciation between 'read' (Present simple) and 'read' (Past simple).

read (Present simple) > "riːd"
read (Past simple) > "red"

# Verb patterns
Some verbs can be followed immediately by another verb. This forms a verb pattern, which quite often expresses a feeling or necessity towards doing something. Verbs like "to want", "to like", and "to prefer" are quite often used as the first verb in a verb pattern.

She likes to work from home on Fridays.
We prefer to take holiday at Christmas.
The verb that follows is sometimes the "to -" form of the verb (the infinitive) and sometimes the "-ing" form of the verb (the gerund). In this unit, we'll focus on verb patterns using the infinitive form. We'll learn more about gerunds later in this level.

I love to go running at the weekend.
I love going running at the weekend.
"Would like", "want" and "need" can only be followed by the infinitive form of a verb, whereas "like" and "prefer" can either be followed by an infinitive or a gerund.

I don't like to work at the weekend. / I don't like working at the weekend.
I prefer to walk to work. / I prefer walking to work.
Did you notice? "Would like" is actually just a form of the verb "to like". To be exact, it's the verb "to like" in the conditional (we'll learn more about this tense later). The main thing to know is that we use "to like" to talk about things that give us enjoyment, and we use "would like" to talk about things that we like the idea of doing. You can see the difference in the examples below.

I like to go swimming at the weekend.
I would like to go swimming at the weekend.
The structure that we have been looking at so far in this unit is subject + verb + infinitive. Here are some more examples.

I (subject) like (verb) to go (infinitive) to the gym in the morning.
He (subject) prefers (verb) to work (infinitive) full-time.
My team (subject) needs (verb) to use (infinitive) this meeting room.
To form a negative sentence with the verb "to prefer", we can use "not". The structure is subject + prefer + not + infinitive.

I prefer not to work at the weekend.
She prefers not to drive to work.

# Past continuous
Here's A Tip
We use the past continuous tense to describe temporary actions that were in progress in the past.

He was using the printer.
I was calling you.
She was replying to some emails.
Another use of the past continuous is to talk about what was happening around a certain time.

What were you doing at 9 o'clock this morning? I was emailing clients.
What were you doing at 5 o'clock this afternoon? I was using the printer.
Using the past continuous implies that the action was in progress for a longer period of time.

I was studying for an exam (all of) yesterday.
I was reading in the library (all day) on Monday.
The past continuous is made up of two parts. We use the past simple form of the verb "to be" (was / were), followed by the -ing form of the main verb.

I was sitting at my desk.
You were using the phone.
He was emailing his colleague.
We were having a meeting.
They were working from home.
Did you notice? All verbs in this tense follow the same pattern as the present continuous. The only difference is that the verb "to be" is in the past and not the present.

Present continuous: They are using this meeting room.
Past continuous: They were using this meeting room.
To form negative sentences in the past continuous tense, we insert the word "not" in-between "was / were" and the -ing verb. We can also contract negative sentences in the past continuous.

She was not using the photocopier.
She wasn't working from home yesterday.
To form questions in the past continuous tense, we swap "was / were" with the subject and add a question mark.

They were working from home on Monday. > Were they working from home on Monday?
Eva was emailing clients yesterday. > Was Eva emailing clients yesterday?
My team was using the meeting room. > Was your team using the meeting room?

# Combining past tenses
Here's A Tip
In the previous unit, we learned about when and how to use the past continuous tense. Until this point in the course, we have used past tenses on their own. In this unit, we'll learn how to use the past tenses we've learned alongside each other, in order to tell short anecdotes about our day.

We often use the past continuous and the past simple tense together. When this happens, the past continuous describes a longer, "background" action or situation and the past simple describes the main action or event. Sometimes the past simple action interrupts the past continuous action.

I was having a meeting with my colleagues (past continuous) when my phone rang (past simple).
I visited my family (past simple) while I was living in the south of France (past continuous).
We can use the words "when" and "while" to join past simple phrases with past continuous phrases. "When" can be used before either a past simple phrase or a past continuous phrase, but "while" can only be used before a past continuous phrase.

My boss called while I was walking to work.
I was using the photocopier when it broke.
So far, we've seen two structures for combining past tenses: past continuous + when + past simple, and past simple + while + past continuous.

Past continuous + when + past simple = I was sitting in the bath when the phone rang.
Past simple + while + past continuous = We visited Paris while we were living in France.
The structure past continuous + when + past simple can be inverted to become past simple + when + past continuous. Both structures give the same meaning.

I was walking home when it started to rain. > It started to rain when I was walking home.
He was working from home when his laptop broke. > His laptop broke when he was working from home.
With past simple + while + past continuous, we can also rearrange the sentence, to put "while" first, and then separate the two past tenses with a comma. Both structures give the same meaning and both are correct.

Her phone rang while she was having a meeting with her team. > While she was having a meeting with her team, her phone rang.
I did lots of work while I was working from home. > While I was working from home, I did lots of work
