# Personal Pronouns - Singular

In Spanish, in order to say who's performing the action, we use personal pronouns. "Yo" (I), "tú" (you, informal), "él" (he), "ella" (she) and "usted" (you, formal) are the singular personal pronouns. Let's have a more detailed look at them!

In Spanish, verbs change depending on who is performing the action. This is why we don't usually use personal pronouns, because the verb indicates who we are talking about.

(Yo) me llamo María. (My name is María.)
(Tú) te llamas Carlos. (Your name is Carlos.)
There are two ways of addressing someone in Spanish: "tú" (you, informal) and "usted" (you, formal).

"Usted" is a more polite way of talking to people we don't know well, someone old or a boss for example.

"Tú" is more informal and we use it with friends, family or someone close to us.

Have you noticed that the verb ending is the same for "él" (he), "ella" (she) and "usted" (you, formal)?

Ella se llama Ana. (She is called Ana.)
Él se llama José. (He is called José.)
Usted se llama Francisco. (You (formal) are called Francisco.)
