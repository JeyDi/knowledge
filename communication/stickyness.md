# How to stick ideas

## Simplicity
We must create ides both simple and profound. The Golden Rule is the ultimate model of simplicity: a one-sentence statement so profound that an individual could spend a life-time learning to follow it.
It's hard to make ideas to stick in a noisy, unpredictable, chaotic environment. The idea is share your vision/your core idea and leave autonomy to everyone to achieve that.

## Unexpectedness
We need to violate people's expectations. We need to be counterintuitive. We must generate interest and curiosity. We can engage people's curiosity over a long period of time by systematically "opening gaps" in their knowledge and then filling those gaps.

## Concreteness
We must explain our ideas in terms of human actions, in terms of sensory information. This is where so much business communication goes awry. Mission statements, synergies, strategies, visions—they are often ambiguous to the point of being meaningless. Naturally sticky ideas are full of concrete images—ice-filled bathtubs, apples with razors—because our brains are wired to remember concrete data. In proverbs, abstract truths are often encoded in concrete language: “A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.” Speaking concretely is the only way to ensure that our idea will mean the same thing to everyone in our audience.

## Credibility
Sticky ideas have to carry their own credentials. We need ways to help people test our ideas for themselves—a “try before you buy” philosophy for the world of ideas.

## Emotions
How do we get people to care about our ideas? We make them feel something. How do we get people to care about our ideas? We make them feel something.

## Stories
Research shows that mentally rehearsing a situation helps us perform better when we encounter that situation in the physical environment.
