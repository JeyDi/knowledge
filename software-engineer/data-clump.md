# Data Clump
Whenever two or three values are gathered together - turn them into a $%#$%^ object.

The first step is to replace data clumps with objects and use the objects whenever you see them. An immediate benefit is that you'll shrink some parameter lists. The interesting stuff happens as you begin to look for behavior to move into the new objects.
