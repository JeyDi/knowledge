# Decorator Pattern
We create objects of a class that wraps another class and pass them around. The class that wraps should have the same interface as the class it is wrapping so that clients donâ€™t know that they are working with a wrapper.

When you use decorator, you create an abstract class that defines the set of operations you need to support. Then you create a subclass that inherits from that abstract class, accepts an instance of the class in its constructor, and provides a body for each of those methods.
