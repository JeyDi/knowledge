# Walking skeleton

When we start a new feature, we usually do a spike and create a "walking skeleton".

A “walking skeleton” is an implementation of the thinnest possible slice of real functionality that we can automatically build, deploy, and test end-to-end.

It should include just enough of the automation, the major com- ponents, and communication mechanisms to allow us to start working on the first feature. We keep the skeleton’s application functionality so simple that it’s obvious and uninteresting, leaving us free to concentrate on the infrastructure.

This permits:
* To understand how to design our system
* To have feedback
* To expose uncertainty early
