# DevOps

A successful devops transformation sees a change in organisational culture. These changes often come in the way of adoption of specific tools or practices.

However, to change culture, you need something more fundamental than just the introduction of new tools, or pushing everyone into Scrum teams.

There are 4 key values to a devops culture:
* Work lean: At its heart, a Lean approach aims to increase value through the reduction of waste. One of the strongest ways to reduce waste is to challenge why we do that activity in the first place.
* Embrace failure: Core to a devops culture is one where we recognize that things will fail. What we need to recognise is it is not the failure by which we will be measured but by how quickly and effectively we respond to the failure
* Automate everything: When we look to automate things we first need to know why we do it, this gives us an opportunity to challenge if this is a valuable step, or just a workaround for another broken process.
* Demand diversity: The right balance of conflict is important to ensure the team is consistently reviewing the current approach and looking for opportunities to reduce waste and deliver more value.
