# Abstraction Principle
Related to [DRY](https://github.com/voxsim/knowledge/blob/master/software-engineer/dont-repeat-yourserlf.md) is the abstraction principle “Each significant piece of functionality in a program should be implemented in just one place in the source code.”

The only way for humans to deal with complexity is to avoid it, by working at higher levels of abstraction. We can get more done if we program by combining components of useful functionality rather than manipulating variables and control flow; that’s why most people order food from a menu in terms of dishes, rather than detail the recipes used to create them.
