# Test Driven Development (TDD)

Test Driven Development is a design technique where:
1. You must write a failing test before you write any production code.
2. You must not write more of a test than is sufficient to fail, or fail to compile.
3. You must not write more production code than is sufficient to make the currently failing test pass.

Remember Kent Beck: Make it work. Make it right. Make it fast.
