# The career of Software Engineer

My idea of what a career in software engineering can be.

Every problem and solution are different, you can say that have "different shape". When you start as software engineer you shold look for different shape and learn from them, otherwise someone could tell you: "Do you have ten years of experience or one year of experience repetaed ten times?". 

One other problem with "one shaped problem" career is that every time you will do something differt you will be slow or in the worst case you will try to reapply your way to do things in that shape scenario and this often create a monster not a new art.

Apart from that we can describe four level for a software engineer:

- Solution implementator produces code when you give him a solution. They need to learn the basics and they should look for works that give them the freedom to implement different solutions.

- Problem solver takes problems and solve them. They take problems, they break them down in solutions and implement them. In some cases they work with some solution implementators. A good problem solver let take different problems to his collaborators and finally he review their job, discussing pro & cons of their choices. Choosing what problem should do a collaborator should be a shared decision: both should stop their ego in favor of the work; a solution implementator should not take too much hard problems and a good problem solver should not take only the shiny part, giving only the boring parts to his collaborators. Don't micromanage. They should look for bigger problems to solve, always different.

- Problem finder takes a context/a goal/a new domain and find problems. His main job is discover and prioritize them, understand what we should do to grow our company or to help our customer. They should help for mentoring and onboarding

-  Founder know a lot about the world, about a community or about developers and from that knowledge they create new contexts. They usually build fast solutions to have an empirical way to measure their success or failure. There is a huge economic around new companies or startups (e.g. https://www.founder.university/) and for most of them the only way to grow up rapidly is owning something.
