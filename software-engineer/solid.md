# SOLID Design Principles 

The SOLID acronym was coined by Michael Feathers and popularized by Robert Martin.

Each letter stands for a well-known principle in object-oriented design.
Here’s a formal definition of each one: 

1. S - Single Responsibility The methods in a class should be cohesive around a single purpose.
2. O - Open-Closed Objects should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
3. L - Liskov Substitution Subclasses should be substitutable for their superclasses.
4. I - Interface Segregation Objects should not be forced to depend on methods they don’t use.
5. D - Dependency Inversion Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

If you find the above definitions less then enlightening, don’t despair.
As principles are referenced in this book, plain language explanations (like the one below) will follow.
