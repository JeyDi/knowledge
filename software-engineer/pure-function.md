## Pure function
Pure function are worry-free:
- Take / return values
- Local scopes: no remote inputs or effects / no notion of time
- Same arguments, same result
- Easy to understand, change, test and compose

Any function that has side effects (see below) is impure.

Procedural functions with no utilized return value are also impure.
