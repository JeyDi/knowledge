# Equational reasoning
With referential transparent expressions we are able to replace symbols with their definition in the same way we'd solve an algebraic expression to it's simplest form. Step after step we could replace a term with an equivalent one; this property enables equational reasoning about programs. On the other hand the substitution property makes reasoning much simpler since all the effects of the evaluation are purely local. This frees our mind from having to track the sequence of the updates in a block of code so that understanding is limited to the function application. Combining smaller functions into bigger ones becomes easier and resembles the act of assembling a product from its components.
