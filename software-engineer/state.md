## State
State refers to the information a program has access to and can operate on at a point in time. This includes data stored in memory as well as OS memory, input/output ports, database, etc. For example, the contents of variables in an application at any given instant are representative of the application's state.

## Stateful
Stateful programs, apps, or components store data in memory about the current state.

## Stateless
Stateless functions or components perform tasks as though running them for the first time, every time. This means they do not reference or utilize any information from earlier in their execution. Statelessness enables referential transparency.
