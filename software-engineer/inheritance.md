# Inheritance

To solve a problem you usually end up creating classes which are related somehow. They share some characteristics or even some behaviors. Since you want to avoid repetition, and thus errors, you want to collect all these common features in a common class. Usually this class is called parent, super or base class. Once you have created this class the other classes can declare to be like it, or to inherit from it. This is called inheritance.
