# Depression vs Sadness
Sadness is just from happenstance and whatever happened or didn't happen for you.
Depression is your body saying fuck you I don't want to be this character anymore; I don't want to hold up this avatar that you have created in the world, it's too much for me. Depressed is like a deep rest that your body needs.
