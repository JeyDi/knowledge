# Ways to have success
- Get used of rejection
- Keep alive your dreams
- Focus on culture
- Focus on people
- Ignore your litle man that stops you to do things
- Gest inspired
- Stay focused
- Customers #1, employee #2, shareholders #3
- Don't complain, look for opportunities
- Have passion
- Favoring consistency over intensity: we should do often the things we care, every moment in a while, instead of doing something a lot in a short time of period
- Be the change you want to see
- Break the rules
- Train your mind
- Be patient
- Take accountability
- Outdo yourself, always try to be better, everyday
- Be the last to speak: A great leader always heard what everyone has to say, don't nod the face, he asks questions to understand everything, he gives to everyone the space and the ability to feel that they have contributed.
- Be authentic
- Always think why you do things
