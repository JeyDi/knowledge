# Failure

Learn to utilize failure and relentlessly seek negative feedback. These strategies speed up the process of improvement and increase your likelihood of success, and the better you do, the more likely you are to want to do even better. Itâ€™s a positive feedback cycle that fuels drive and accomplishment. Use failure as a tool, not an outcome to avoid.
