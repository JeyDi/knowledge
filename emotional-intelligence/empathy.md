# Empathy
Empathy fuels connection, instead Simpathy drives disconnection. Empathy has four qualities:
- Perspective taking, the ability to take the perspective of another person or recognise their perspective as their truth
- Staying out of judgement, not easy when enjoy it as much us do
- Recognising emotion of other people, then communicating that
- Empathy is feeling WITH people
  - Empathy good phrase is "I know what it's like down here and you are not alone"
  - Instead simphaty is "Uuuh, is bad? ah?"

Empathy is a choice, a vulnerable choice, because in order to connect we have to connect with something that knows that feeling.

Simpathy try to address the vulnerability trying to change the discourse or galvanize with the good part.

A good empathy person say "I don't even know how to say, but I am just glad that you told me"; because the thruth is rarely an answer makes something better; what makes something better is connection.
