# Forgiveness
* forgiveness isn't forgetting
* forgiveness isn't about trusting someone who hasn't earned it
* forgiveness isn't a removal of consequences
* forgiveness isn't pretending that nothing happening and everything is ok
* forgiveness isn't a complete restoration of a relationship
* forgiveness is more about you: it's setting myself free in whatever they did to me
