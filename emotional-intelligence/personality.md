# Personality

There are three stages for every living being:
* baby: an humble insecure personality that he is incapable of dominating the environment that surrounds him.
* adult: an egoist/alone personality that he is capable of dominating the environment that surrounds him.
* parent: He is an adult who has become so good at getting food, dominating the environment around him, defending himself from dangers, avoiding threats, getting rid of fear, being sure of himself, allowing himself luxury to be interested in others, and in particular for children, and to assist them, protect them, nourish them, defend them, reassure them and cuddle them. The parent is able to dedicate himself to others.

The parent is the only one that is capable to love each other.

Humans are characterized by a fourth personality called "buddhahood". A buddha is an enlightened, a sage, who has reached awareness and serenity.
