# Personality

There are three stages for every living being:
* baby: an humble insecure personality that he is incapable of dominating the environment that surrounds him.
* adult: an egoist/alone personality that he is capable of dominating the environment that surrounds him.
* parent: He is an adult who has become so good at getting food, dominating the environment around him, defending himself from dangers, avoiding threats, getting rid of fear, being sure of himself, allowing himself luxury to be interested in others, and in particular for children, and to assist them, protect them, nourish them, defend them, reassure them and cuddle them. The parent is able to dedicate himself to others.

The parent is the only one that is capable to love each other.

Humans are characterized by a fourth personality called "buddhahood". A buddha is an enlightened, a sage, who has reached awareness and serenity.

## Adult Behaviour
1. Be patient. No matter what.
2. Don’t badmouth: Assign responsibility, never blame. Say nothing behind another’s back you’d be unwilling to say, in exactly the same tone and language, to his face.
3. Never assume the motives of others are, to them, less noble than yours are to you.
4. Expand your sense of the possible.
5. Don’t trouble yourself with matters you truly cannot change.
6. Expect no more of anyone than you yourself can deliver.
7. Tolerate ambiguity.
8. Laugh at yourself frequently.
9. Concern yourself with what is right rather than who is right.
10. Never forget that, no matter how certain, you might be wrong.
11. Give up blood sports.
12. Remember that your life belongs to others as well. Do not endanger it frivolously. And never endanger the life of another.
13. Never lie to anyone for any reason. (Lies of omission are sometimes exempt.)
14. Learn the needs of those around you and respect them.
15. Avoid the pursuit of happiness. Seek to define your mission and pursue that.
16. Reduce your use of the first personal pronoun.
17. Praise at least as often as you disparage.
18. Never let your errors pass without admission.
19. Become less suspicious of joy.
20. Understand humility.
21. Forgive.
22. Foster dignity.
23. Live memorably.
