# Happiness

The path for happiness starts with realizing that almost nothing is as bad as you think it is when you’re thinking about it. We have a unique ability to imagine and plan for the future, but we’re often bad at it. We do so with our current feelings in mind and not the feelings of our future selves. We overlook our immense adaptability to our surroundings.

Know that how you feel depends on how you respond. Of course, adversity doesn’t just go away because we want it to, and certain circumstances really can cause a prolonged state of unhappiness. That said, we can use framing tactics like seeking meaning and growth in hardship to better respond to our environmental stressors.

There’s a way to bring the whole concept together, and it’s by cultivating the ability to adjust internal expectations. Over time, whether or not you feel good or bad depends on how consistently reality exceeds or falls short of what you expect. The secret lies in how swiftly you can adjust the lever of these expectations once you’ve fallen short.
