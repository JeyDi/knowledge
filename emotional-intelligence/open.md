# Being Open

It cannot be overstated the importance of openness.

Expect nothing. This sounds bleak, but it's about the idea that when you don't
expect anything from other people or things, they will delight you over and over
again -- all without any disappointments.

Cherish people for their oddities and idiosyncracies. Don't hold them up to your
own set of values you live by: they aren't you.

See each of the world's disregards of your expectations as an opportunity, not a
cosmic insult. Learn to explore, not expect.

It took a long time for me to realize that people can tell the difference
between when you're open or closed. We can't connect with closed people. We
cannot connect with others when we are closed. Be open with others. Confidence
is born from trust.
