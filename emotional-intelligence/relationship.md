# Relantionship
Don't change people outside, if they want they will change

If we are always mean to people who have hurt us, we are giving the perfect reason to not listen us. Whereas a calm, dignified confession of vulnerability is nearly impossible to ignore

The essence of talking about of himself is premerely in self-clarification, not merely in hearing our voices.

We can ends up understanding ourselves listening to the stories of other people. Usually anyone thinks that something that you say are important and others are boring, this is wrong.

In listening, can also shape, tease out, cut out, emphasise - in the name of getting the latent really good story to emerge from our companion's mind. So when listening, stop your companion digressing, bring back together to the last coherent and emotionally 'alive' part of the story. Draw them from numb surface details to deeper emotional realities, like 'What did feel like for you?' . Use signs that suggests an open mind. Don't do anything that close off a vulnerable confession, say 'go on..' you are not to judge, you are a friend. A good listener knows the one of the best ways to understand an issue in one's own life is to hear it discussed through the life of someone else - and futhermore he has the editing skills to make sure they can find themselves in the word of others. That way, listening will no longer a chore.


## Management Strategies
1. Be open and be curious. Sharing things about yourself will leave less room for people to misinterpret you, and the more you know about someone else, the more clearly you can interpret their emotional signals.
2. Enhance your natural communication style. We can all benefit from understanding and adjusting our natural communication style. The authors suggest another writing exercise, with the positives of your style on one side and the negatives on the other. Ask friends or family to help you define the ups and downs, and pick a few of each to emphasize or to work on.
3. Avoid giving mixed signals. It’s possible to be saying something that’s on your mind while simultaneously exhibiting body language that shows a different emotion that is still lingering from a completely separate situation or conversation. Stay aware of your emotions to make sure that your body and voice match your words. If they don’t, explain why so people don’t get mixed signals.
4. Remember the little things that pack a punch. Add back some old-fashioned good manners into the way you talk if you’re not already in the habit of saying the little things like “please,” “thank you,” and “I’m sorry.”
5. Take feedback well. Appreciate the feedback you get, and be mindful of your response. Ask for examples in order to really understand what is being said, and thank the person for the feedback. It’s hard to give feedback as well as get it. Many of the previous points apply; consider sleeping on the feedback, or making an emotion vs. reason list.
6. Build trust. Start the trust-building process by being the first person to “be open” and share something about yourself. I’ll directly quote the authors for the steps to continue building trust: “Open communication; willingness to share; consistency in words, actions, and behavior over time; and reliability in following through on the agreements of the relationship.”
7. Have an “open-door” policy. The point here is to find specific ways increase your accessibility to others, not to make your time available to anyone at any time.
8. Only get mad on purpose. It is healthy to express anger in a way that communicates you have strong feelings, or that a situation is serious. Use anger sparingly and purposefully, instead of letting it control you. Again, the authors suggest putting pen to paper; write down things that make you angry, from the minor annoyances to the things that make you explode. Specifically define the degree of anger in each situation that would improve the relationship. If it’s not possible, anger isn’t appropriate for the situation.
9. Don’t avoid the inevitable. When you’re faced with a situation you don’t like, don’t withdraw; it will only make things worse. Apply your EQ skills to find something that helps you through the situation or improves it.
10. Acknowledge the other person’s feelings. Accept others’ right to experience their emotions without either pushing those feelings aside or making them a big deal. Respect the right to those feelings, even if you don’t agree with the feelings themselves. Listen and repeat back what you’ve heard to show your understanding and concern.
11. Complement the person’s emotions or situation. We often have a tendency to reflect the other person’s emotions, but responding to anger with anger, for example, will only make things worse. Take the time to consider some past situations you’ve experienced, and think about when someone else acted in a way that complemented your emotions, making the interaction a pleasant one.
12. When you care, show it. Small acts of appreciation can create powerful relationships.
13. Explain your decisions, don’t just make them. People need to understand why a decision was made in order to support it. Take the time to verbalize your decision process, including what the alternatives were and why you made the decision you did. Seek input before the decision if possible, and always acknowledge the effects of your decision. The authors suggest looking through your calendar to identify your next three upcoming decisions, consider who will be affected, prepare explanations, etc.
14. Make your feedback direct and constructive. The key to giving good feedback is to consider the person who is receiving the feedback, and to adapt your approach accordingly. Take the time to consider the person beforehand.
15. Align your intention with your impact. Times when your impact didn’t align with your intention will give you clues about the areas of your EQ you can improve. Think about times when you unintentionally caused hard feelings, or relationships that seem illogically strained.
16. Offer a “fix-it” statement during a broken conversation. Learn to recognize when a conversation is deteriorating, and say something like, “This is hard,” or “How are you feeling?” Offer a reset button to restore open lines of communication.
17. Tackle a tough conversation. Tough conversations will come up no matter how high your EQ is. The authors offer a six-part approach to managing them better:

* Start the discussion with common ground.
* Ask the other person to help you understand how he or she feels.
* Don’t defend your point of view until you’ve heard the other person’s perspective.
* Then help the other person understand your side – your reasoning, your feelings, etc. Apologize, if appropriate, for the difficulty of the situation.
* Move the conversation forward once what can be said has been said. Obtain agreement on next steps.
* Follow up concerning what you’ve discussed at a later time as a means of genuinely addressing the issues.
