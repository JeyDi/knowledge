# Relantionship
Don't change people outside, if they want they will change

If we are always mean to people who have hurt us, we are giving the perfect reason to not listen us. Whereas a calm, dignified confession of vulnerability is nearly impossible to ignore

The essence of talking about of himself is premerely in self-clarification, not merely in hearing our voices.

We can ends up understanding ourselves listening to the stories of other people. Usually anyone thinks that something that you say are important and others are boring, this is wrong.

In listening, can also shape, tease out, cut out, emphasise - in the name of getting the latent really good story to emerge from our companion's mind. So when listening, stop your companion digressing, bring back together to the last coherent and emotionally 'alive' part of the story. Draw them from numb surface details to deeper emotional realities, like 'What did feel like for you?' . Use signs that suggests an open mind. Don't do anything that close off a vulnerable confession, say 'go on..' you are not to judge, you are a friend. A good listener knows the one of the best ways to understand an issue in one's own life is to hear it discussed through the life of someone else - and futhermore he has the editing skills to make sure they can find themselves in the word of others. That way, listening will no longer a chore.
