# Creativity

Don’t wait for inspiration to get moving. Creativity is a process.
Even the seemingly sporadic insights – like the ones we get in the shower – rely on what came before them.
Inspiration doesn’t just strike for no reason.
It relies on a consistent pattern of work that sometimes manifests itself in the form of those rare moments.
To truly practice creativity, commit to a schedule, show up, and get to work, whether you want to or not.

Seek relationships between existing ideas. Nothing new is completely original.
Creativity is simply about producing something using a combination of the existing elements of your reality.
Start by developing a mental inventory of relevant knowledge, work to connect the dots, and then support those connections
with a logical structure.

Produce a large volume of work. Creativity doesn’t work unless you do.
Produce in the face of failure, and produce in the face of subpar results.
It’s easy to forget that not every piece of work created by a genius was all that great.
A lot of it wasn’t. It’s just not talked about. Creating bad work is necessary in order to uncover great work.

The first step in cultivating creativity is understanding what it is.
Once you do that, you open yourself up to an entirely new realm of possibility; a kind of possibility capable of inspiring solutions to almost any problem that you encounter in life – personal or professional.
Mastering creativity is in some ways itself an art, and like any art, it can empower you.
