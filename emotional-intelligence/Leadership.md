# Leadership
The golden circle (why / how / what): From the lowest level to the highest level of leadership. Everyone knows what they do, some of them knows how to do them, and very few knows why they do them and for why we intends "what's your purpose? What's your cause? What do you beleif? Why your organization do exists". The inspiring people communicate from the inside to out, before they explains why, after how and finally what. Usually a lot of people they just explain what and how and make implicity why. People buy why we do it.

Our neocortex brain corresponds with 'what level', it is responsible with all rational and analytical thought and language. The middle two sections make up our limbic brains and they are responsible for all of our feelings/decisions and that's why people buy why we do it.

This people spend a lot for new things and they not did for the thing itself, but they did for himself.

Leaders don't hold a position of power or authority, but those who lead inspire us.
