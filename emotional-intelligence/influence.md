# Influence
Influence can be achieved around six guiding principles:

## Reciprocation
Making people want to do a favor to others who have already done a favor to them (even only seemingly so).

## Consistency
Making people “lock onto” one behavior and not abandoning it, even if this behavior turns out to be disadvantageous.

## Social proof
Having people orient themselves to the behavior of others.

## Authority
Where people gladly accept “orders” (or mere “hints”) by supposed experts or figures of authority.

## Liking
Making people tend to comply with others who they like.

## Scarcity
Making people crave that which they cannot (easily) have.
