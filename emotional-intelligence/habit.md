# Habit

1) Identify the routine. Though it’s not always obvious, the easiest part is usually identifying the behavior you want to change.

2) Experiment with rewards. You can then fill in the “routine” part of the habit loop, but to pinpoint the cue you first have to experiment with rewards. Try out a new reward each time you feel the urge to complete the routine. For example, if you find yourself eating junk food every afternoon, try eating an apple instead, or drinking some coffee, or chatting with a friend for a few minutes. Then set a 15 minute timer, and when it goes off ask yourself if you are still feeling the same urge. If you are, you haven’t yet identified the cue. Keep experimenting, and you’ll eventually figure out if you were actually hungry (in which case the apple would work), if you were tired (in which case the coffee should help), or if you just needed a break (which your friend should provide).

3) Isolate the cue. Once you’ve determined the reward that satisfies the cue, there is still work to be done to understand exactly what the cue is. Most habitual cues will fall into five categories:

  * Location
  * Time
  * Emotional state
  * Other people
  * An immediately preceding action

If you have a habit you’re serious about changing, keep a log of your location, the time, your emotional state, the people    around you, and the action you take immediately prior to your habit. After a few repetitions, you’ll probably be able to see the pattern.

4) Have a plan. Once you’ve recognized the precise routine, reward, and cue, it should be easy to design a different routine that provides the same reward after the same cue. Stay alert for the cue (or set an automatic alert if it’s time-based), and act out your pre-planned routine. If it works, you’ve confirmed that you found the right cue and reward, and your habit will then be easily moldable.
