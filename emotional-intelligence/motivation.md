# How works motivation
As long as the task involved only mechanical skills:
- If you *reward* something do you get *more* of that behaviour
- If you *punish* something do you get *less* of that behaviour

This does not work when the task involved cognitive skills:
- If you don't pay people enough, they won't be motivated
- After money, there are three factors that leads to better performance and personal satisfaction: autonomy, mastery and purpose.
