# Epiphany
- There are two types of law in this world: those that are made by a higher authority and those are made by men. And not until all the laws that are made by men are consistent with the laws made by a higher authority will we live in a just world.
- Know other people that can tell you what you really are, what you think about yourself are just illusions, you should think harder and analyze yourself.
- Apart of the former couple, you can couple with your mind with many others, that can stimulate yourself.

# Emapthy vs Sumpathy
Empathy fuels connection, instead Simpathy drives disconnection. Empathy has four qualities:
- Perspective taking, the ability to take the perspective of another person or recognise their perspective as their truth
- Staying out of judgement, not easy when enjoy it as much us do
- Recognising emotion of other people, then communicating that
- Empathy is feeling WITH people
-> Empathy good phrase is "I know what it's like down here and you are not alone"
-> Instead simphaty is "Uuuh, is bad? ah?"
Empathy is a choice, a vulnerable choice, because in order to connect I have to connect with something that knows that feeling.
Simpathy try to address the vulnerability trying to change the discourse or galvanize with the good part.
A good empathy person say "I don't even know how to say, but I am just glad that you told me"; because the thruth is rarely an answer make something better; what makes something better is connection.

# Depression vs Sadness
Sadness is just from happenstance and whatever happened or didn't happen for you.
Depression is your body saying fuck you I don't want to be this character anymore; I don't want to hold up this avatar that you have created in the world, it's too much for me. Depressed is like a deep rest that your body needs.

# Buddhism, Zen, Stoicism, ...

I've been studying buddhism since August 2016. Quite by accident in fact, when I
came across *Fearless* by Brenda Shoshanna, whose heady mixture of modern
psychology and ancient buddhist wisdom acted as a gateway drug into a whole new
way of looking at my mind and the world.

In more recent times, I've also been studying ancient and modern stoic writings
and trying to experiment with putting these ideas into practice in my day to day
life.

## Finding Books

Many spiritual practices have been around for an exceedingly long time. This
works to your advantage in many ways. One such way is that your public library
will likely be a great resource for such books.

Your local library will have dozens of books on the subject, providing a near
endless source of free wisdom for the aspiring adventurer of the mind.

## Being Open

It cannot be overstated the importance of openness.

Expect nothing. This sounds bleak, but it's about the idea that when you don't
expect anything from other people or things, they will delight you over and over
again -- all without any disappointments.

Cherish people for their oddities and idiosyncracies. Don't hold them up to your
own set of values you live by: they aren't you.

See each of the world's disregards of your expectations as an opportunity, not a
cosmic insult. Learn to explore, not expect.

It took a long time for me to realize that people can tell the difference
between when you're open or closed. We can't connect with closed people. We
cannot connect with others when we are closed. Be open with others. Confidence
is borne from trust.

The beauty of a face is calculated by:
- averaging
- simmetry
- effects of hormones

Simmetry is also an indicator of health
