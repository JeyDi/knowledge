# Buddhism

There are three stages for every living being:
* baby: an humble insecure personality that he is incapable of dominating the environment that surrounds him.
* adult: an egoist/alone personality that he is capable of dominating the environment that surrounds him.
* parent: He is an adult who has become so good at getting food, dominating the environment around him, defending himself from dangers, avoiding threats, getting rid of fear, being sure of himself, allowing himself luxury to be interested in others, and in particular for children, and to assist them, protect them, nourish them, defend them, reassure them and cuddle them. The parent is able to dedicate himself to others.

The parent is the only one that is capable to love each other.

Humans are characterized by a fourth personality called "buddhahood".

Buddhism has this only one practical purpose: eliminate any pains by realizing Buddhahood, which takes place in a permanent state of serenity.

In a pratical view, the buddhism aims:
1. The awareness that everything change
2. Detachment
3. Control your mind
4. Live the reality
5. Universal love / Radical acceptance

## The awareness that everything change

## Detachment
Detachment, also expressed as non-attachment, is a state in which a person overcomes his or her attachment to desire for things, people or concepts of the world and thus attains a heightened perspective.

## Control your mind

## Live the reality

## Universal love / Radical acceptance
Learning to love yourself is the first step in learning to love others. For loving yourself, I mean everything of your past and every possible futures.
When you have learned to accept, to forgive you, to have compassion for your sufferings, for your illusions, for your passions, for your dreams, for your disappointments, for your defeats, for your wounds, you will have learned to to love you.

And *in that time* you can love others.

Because you will then see in others your own sufferings, your own illusions, your own passions, your own dreams, your own disappointments, your own defeats, your own wounds.

This is basically love: seeing ourselves in the other.
