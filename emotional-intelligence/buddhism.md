# Buddhism

Buddhism has only one practical purpose: eliminate any pains by realizing Buddhahood, which takes place in a permanent state of serenity.

In a pratical view, the buddhism aims:
1. The awareness that everything change
2. Detachment
3. Control your mind
4. Live the reality
5. Universal love / Radical acceptance

## The awareness that everything change

## Detachment
Detachment, also expressed as non-attachment, is a state in which a person overcomes his or her attachment to desire for things, people or concepts of the world and thus attains a heightened perspective.

## Control your mind

## Live the reality

## Universal love / Radical acceptance
Learning to love yourself is the first step in learning to love others. For loving yourself, I mean everything of your past and every possible futures.
When you have learned to accept, to forgive you, to have compassion for your sufferings, for your illusions, for your passions, for your dreams, for your disappointments, for your defeats, for your wounds, you will have learned to to love you.

And *in that time* you can love others.

Because you will then see in others your own sufferings, your own illusions, your own passions, your own dreams, your own disappointments, your own defeats, your own wounds.

This is basically love: seeing ourselves in the other.
